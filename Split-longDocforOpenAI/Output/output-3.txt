This is part number 3

20:44 Abdullah Ollivierre: Sort of buy myself a little more time. You can just give it a bogus name here and right there. Feature updated deploy. I can select which feature update, which means your version of Windows I need to lock. So for example some organizations they're not ready to roll out or to even offer users Windows 11. So I don't want my users to be able to upgrade their computers to Windows 11 so I can go right here and freeze or sort of quote UN quote lock their devices so they will never be offered the Windows 11 upgrade on their computers.
21:14 Darren Walker: And and and. How do you specify that freeze just?
21:18 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah, I so I can select it right here from the drop down menu. I can say, yeah, I I can. I can say which which measure version of Windows I want to freeze these computers on SQL they will never be offered any. Now keep in mind if they were already on a newer version from what you've selected here.
21:36 Darren Walker: Right.
21:41 Abdullah Ollivierre: If they're already running Windows 11, they're not going to go back to Windows, Windows 10. However, if they're already, if they're running a equal or less than your desired state, then of course it will. That computer will stay.
21:58 Darren Walker: And is there any way for the end user story? Is there any way for the end user to override that that freeze no.
22:02 Abdullah Ollivierre: If they get the policy, no, unless unless they have an admin on their computer.
22:07 Darren Walker: All right, cool.
22:09 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah, if if you have, if you have a local admin on your machine, you can do pretty much anything.
22:12 Darren Walker: Yeah.
22:13 Abdullah Ollivierre: Right. Yeah, of course. It never, never give. Unless, of course, you know, if you have a specific, you know, group of people that you give admin to, obviously we we expect them to be responsible about what they do with their admin. But yeah, unless unless they have admin, if they have a standard user, any policies you would push through group policy or through this modern vehicle called Microsoft Intune, it's not, it's not possible to override that. And that's and that's the power of this essentially it gives you the IT pretty much.
22:44 Abdullah Ollivierre: All, all the control that you want. The the the last thing here in in this year is quality updates. Quality updates is where where you have those expedited cycle for essentially for you know for security updates and bug fixes and things like that. Yeah, that's kind of sort of a quick overview of how this back, you know the the back end of Microsoft Intune, this new modern cloud based environment looks like.
23:12 Darren Walker: It's $28.00 a month for user 20 a month. Wow, I don't think so. 300 bucks a year. OK.
23:21 Abdullah Ollivierre: How sorry. What was that? What was that? What was that pricing?
23:25 Darren Walker: $28.00 per user per month.
23:27 Abdullah Ollivierre: That's. Yeah, that's where the that's where the business premium and my recommendation is to get the business premium because it's the the best value for your buck. However, you can buy just the Microsoft Intune license, let's recommend it to be honest with you. Like for example I, Microsoft, Intune license standalone, if you just wanna buy it by itself.
23:49 Abdullah Ollivierre: That would be. Part of EMS as well, but. I think. That would be somewhere, don't I? Don't don't. Don't. Don't call me on the number, but. But I think around 8:00 or 9 Canadian dollars, a user a month. If you just wanna buy the the standalone license for India.
24:09 Darren Walker: OK.
24:10 Abdullah Ollivierre: So the the this is the EMS E3. Endpoint management Endpoint management is is the when you see the the, the, the the word endpoint management, that's the code word for Intune.
24:21 Darren Walker: Ohh OK.
24:22 Abdullah Ollivierre: Uh, yeah, so mobile app management, MDM and MDM is is is so you can as I said you know you can get into it as part of bundles either the Microsoft 365 business premium, the one you guys just highlighted there $28.00. Plus whatever. Uh applicable taxes per user per month or another bundle is the EMS bundle. It's a little more cost effective bundle, so that's another recommended bundle to look at. Or you can buy the standalone Intune license if you're working with an MSP or channel there for $8.00 user month as well. So you have different options to either get the bundles or the standalone.
24:59 Abdullah Ollivierre: I depending on where you are, my commendations to give that I know the business stream is little more on the. I would say the higher end, but it gives you a lot of other security features that you will find very helpful as you're as you're managing those devices through Microsoft intern because you're end state might not just be Windows updates. I may wanna also roll out compliance policies to these devices and that's where I think that's where the other features in the business premium comes into place. Like these compliance policies. That's your end state is like I wanna make sure that these devices are healthy or unhealthy, are they compliant or in compliant.
25:34 Abdullah Ollivierre: With, with with the, with the company's policies. So.
25:38 Darren Walker: If we just wanted the basic basic endpoint management, they're bucks a month. Well, what functionality don't we get? You know off.
25:46 Abdullah Ollivierre: No, that's a good question. Yeah. So if you just want to get the standalone Intune license, one of the things that you will not get is the identity side, the conditional access. That's a very important feature in my opinion, because this.
26:03 Abdullah Ollivierre: Can can can do not? Can block access. If they don't have their firewall turned on, for example, or if they don't have an antivirus installed on their computer, or if they're antivirus is out of date, so using conditional access policies or depending on which IP they're coming from, so conditional access is very powerful way to control access to your organization's resources and data. Your Office 365. So that's one of the things that you will not get if you just go with the standalone into and license. However you go with the business.
26:35 Darren Walker: But does this include the Office 365 outlook license as well? Or it is just the? Endpoint management and security.
26:45 Abdullah Ollivierre: Good question. So if you go with the Microsoft 365 business premium.
26:49 Darren Walker: We don't, we don't want the business premium because we Office 365 is managed by Auto Hospital. So we cannot have a different. E-mail to myself. That's why the 365. Really doesn't work for us but scheme.
27:07 Abdullah Ollivierre: So the business premium does include Word, Excel and Outlook. If that answers question as well as OneDrive. So you can simply upgrade those existing licenses that you have to business premium without and you won't lose your e-mail or domain or any settings. It's just as simple license upgrade.
27:23 Darren Walker: But we don't have admin access to the Exchange Office 365.
27:28 Abdullah Ollivierre: I see gotcha, but yeah.
27:31 Darren Walker: So that doesn't make any sense.
27:33 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah, yeah, I know for sure. And so, so, in, in this case, you know, as I said, depending on your requirements, you know you can you can either buy it as a bundle of that doesn't make sense for your organization. You can also consider buying the standalone license or if you wanna buy the somewhere, like if you wanna go somewhere in between the business premium and the standalone, the EMS, the enterprise Mobility Security package is also another good option to look at because that one.
27:57 Darren Walker: So is there something cheaper than the $8.00 month option?
27:59 Abdullah Ollivierre: I know that for Intune, for, for.
28:02 Darren Walker: In tunes, no, there might be other another MDM solutions personal.
28:06 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah, you you would probably want to look at other MDM solutions but but in two and four you know with what it offers for 8/8 ish, $9 Canadian a user a month, I think it's pretty good.
28:17 Darren Walker: Ohk. OK. How are you giving 2 minutes.
28:19 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah.
28:20 Darren Walker: OK, So what can be done for WSS server right now?
28:26 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah. So just, just going back, I think I think my recommendation is to start looking at because you know we the end, the end goal here is we would like to know.
28:39 Abdullah Ollivierre: We'd like to know the final count of how many devices that are truly not running the latest version of Windows 10, like as of now, when we look at these computers right here I see a lot of computers. I see a lot of room for cleanup and so if we look at these computers right here, I see at least 171 that are not disabled. So I wanted I wanted to also check with you to see if these numbers make sense to you. If we truly have 171 computers.
29:09 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah.
29:09 Darren Walker: So we do have, we do have the those many computers, but with the epic came in we got so many TH devices that are on TH net sub I mean domain. So we have to take those clinical devices back which is which are on the shelves right now.
29:29 Abdullah Ollivierre: Right.
29:29 Darren Walker: So those are not connected to the domain. In past former five months for sure. Since November 7th go live date so.
29:40 Abdullah Ollivierre: I see.
29:41 Darren Walker: But they are on the domain they are over here. So if it if I need to replace with another device I can do that. But the issue is. Can we at least do something that we can create a policy that it is forcing the device that are currently on the domain they are connected to the Internet and everything forced pushed the policy. They don't have to do anything. It is forced push and force installed.
30:12 Darren Walker: And then rebooted within two days or three days time after the policy I've after the update is installed. Force reboot. If they don't reboot themselves.
30:24 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely. So, actually, let's take a look at what you have today.
30:29 Darren Walker: And meanwhile I can I can go through all the devices that we have on the network and we all start disabling the device so I can connect with you and we can delete those devices from the network or disable them or whatever you suggest. We can do that.
30:43 Abdullah Ollivierre: Yeah, no, absolutely. So I'm looking at the. This report here as well, so this is the computers report, not the users report, so reporting on users is different from reporting on computers just to keep that in mind. So within more than 180 days you have 300 and. 56 devices that are listed in Active Directory that have not logged in within.
31:09 Darren Walker: Surveillance set these up, everything.
31:12 Abdullah Ollivierre: More than 180 days. And then obviously you're most used domain controller is your DC-1. And then DCL two is acting as a. You know, as a as as yeah, as as a, as a secondary or a backup essentially. So they're both active right now, of DC-1 is a primary and you know you're looking at this year's ideally what we'd like to do, gentlemen, is, is to clean up as much as we can so that when we're doing these, this upkeep, this ongoing reporting and reviews on your Active Directory domain domain environment.
31:48 Abdullah Ollivierre: Uh, we we get accurate reports and and and and as as as much as possible of of device count that truly needs to be on the latest version of Windows 10. Like based on what I'm looking at here, 22 out of your 171 are already running the latest build which is 2202. So that's fine. So this is good. So actually we can highlight this with green and by the way, I don't know if you know this the report that I sent you you can double click on this number right here in Microsoft Excel.
32:15 Darren Walker: Yeah.
32:16 Abdullah Ollivierre: And it will show you just those 22 computers right here.
32:19 Darren Walker: OK, that I didn't know.
32:21 Abdullah Ollivierre: So you can. Yeah. So I know. I know. Because sometimes when I send these reports to to customers, they look at the report and they like Abdul. It's all grouped together. I I need the source data. I need the. I need to go back to the source. So if you need the source of those summary summary views, so actually you can delete that you can double click on any one of these summarized groupings here and it will take you back to the source data for those specific ones.
32:47 Darren Walker: That's cool. It's so sorry. Abdullah. I have to step out with that Phillips guy for those carts. So I'll let you stay here with you, man, but appreciate your help there.
32:55 Abdullah Ollivierre: No, for sure. Thank you. There. Thank you. Uh, so yeah, really, he managed to, for example. So these ones right here. So right now if you think about it, we have 171. So if we say this 171 minus the 22 that you already have on the latest.
33:15 Darren Walker: Yeah.
33:16 Abdullah Ollivierre: So you have 149 devices that are not patched with the latest Windows 10 version.
33:21 Darren Walker: Yeah, I think it would be approx 49 devices. 100 devices are not there anymore. Might be way older devices or those were replaced and those were still in the domain. Ohh not deleted.
