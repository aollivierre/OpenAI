This is part number 3
right? So is that You know. This conversation that you're having with horizon will say. It's going to open your eyes regardless of the overcome. Like if it's uh, Well, no thanks at least. It's a You've gone through a bit of the process, you understand, maybe some of the concerns that would, you know? And, In the meantime, there's still a parallel work of Computers. Got to try to get better. Regardless, right. Whether it's, you know, Now, or for the future, right? So, i mean, it's one one shouldn't really under the two separate things. It's it's good because you still got to have goal so i'm going to go forward. So Makes sense. Uh, guess i've seen my point of what the svvcdc for, for example, and i don't know if i try to explain avoid a little bit. Do you think we would have potential people? Would, you know, or would you yourself? This thing because we want to apply, there's a process, right? But we don't just simply apply if there isn't tangible interests, right? I'm just a reminder up to 45 percent, right is what you get, you get, not up to you, get 45 percent, you get 45 percent back in tax credit. Foreign for whatever you invest, right? So that's very good program, 25k you get worse? Five percent of that back in tax credit, right? So, if you are owing, Manitoba tax this month, you get it back, two years back. Eight or ten years forward. Yeah, so if you paid to the last two years, this much of tax to my job, You would get that back in your next tax filing, right? Up to 45 percent. Maybe that's what you mean by up to up to 45% of what you invested and if you still have a little more room, you will still continue to get tax credit in the next eight years up to 45 percent Is that making sense? What's the caveat though? You give the money back obviously but it's interesting. How was it your investing? So it's it's basically say you wanted to invest in a Manitoba company that's registered in the spcdc. It's my total government program. Okay? University hockey. The government factor, but to basically stimulate entrepreneurship and keep the business economy flowing they are Making incentives, you're creating incentive programs for local investors to invest in those companies. And their way of doing that is giving them 45 percent. Tax credit of major attacks credit. Of what the invested. So does that work every year? Like you say going back to years, two years back and eight years forward, but until you get the 40% buck, but you threw out a number of 25 grand. For instance When you get 45 percent of 9.5 two years and then back to forward. 45 percent over 25k or is it over so say, 10k, in my top tax rate in the last two years, you would get 10k. Okay. Uh that's and you'll get up to 45 percent of the 25k. So what's 45 percent of 25k? Let's say it's 12k. Yeah, something like that. Sure. So eleven k, is 45 percent of the 25k. For example, let's assume. You would get a new pay 10k in my talk attacks in the last two years you would get 10k. And you would still have to get one more game. Uh, or so and you would get it in the next year. Once you Once you accrue those taxes, so Because you pay 10k, they will give you 10k back. But in the next year say you owe them, i talk about taxes, 1k or 10k, you would pay what you owe and they will return to you. Uh that one game that's remaining right now automatically everybody here is who is working a full time on a t4? They there's my talk about tax being paid on their behalf right and there is also federal tax being paid on their behalf. So whatever you pay that. That's part of what you will get back. Two years back. And then eight years old. So if you haven't never played taxes in the last two years or you don't simply don't, you're not in the bracket then. You can get that 45 percent back in the future and the future. Yeah, they will never pay you money. Free. Basically. They'll never pay your free money. What they saving you is money. Yeah. They're saving you not. They're not paying no money. They're saving you. Yeah. That's sort of. That's probably the best. Yeah, yeah. So why i'm bringing this is i'm just wanting to take your opinion. You guys are the closest to network to the company. Is it effective for me to go spend the effort to apply and qualify the company there. It's quite like the general procedure, i even spoke to that program coordinator from the government should equalify, but you just have to do the application as it worth it for us to do it, would you or you know of a negative on your network? Think that it's worth want to invest here? And become part of the ownership team. Make a decisions. Potentially, get get some return. Now you, of course, might by the investor you want to okay? Sure, i'm interested. But what do i get? And that's about the question you saw our numbers earlier and we're headed in a positive. You know. Uh, direction. I do expect. I i do have a rough idea. For whoever wants to invest to get roughly 10 to 15 percent in return a year. And the next years from whatever they invested, Whether we do it on a monthly basis or an annual basis, but i do for envision that we will start to see those nice margins. So, i'm I'm sharing this with you because again, you deserve to to be no to know these opportunities. There's the other ways, of course, i'm starting our company to others, but why sell? If we have a, if we have a good company in place here, that's moving in a good direction where we can Uh, control and maneuver and And drive and even invest and get returns. Uh, versus selling them being out and So, Maybe we'll do, i don't know. Yeah, let's see here like i know my family and the lowest time. For example, we have some interest to inject some money in the near future into the company, to just get it to a good places to basically have four, creating the scalable sales process to afford some more processes in place. And and we are like my family, for example, they say oh why should you know, we have a lot of capital, what should i put it here? Well, i tell them, well, it's a good place for you to, you know, to get some some return and so on. So i'm as cautious about this As. You know, because we're going to be putting some our own family time, family resources as well. Uh, But that's from my perception about your comment about a quick and no just do it around 10. No, that's good. So yeah. So like so as as a And you don't have to be a manitoba resident right to. Well you can invest from anywhere but any qualify for this plan. Yeah, to qualify the company has to be a managerial problem, and but the investor investor is to get some return. They have to be made out of interest management of investors. They have to be already have to be contributing to the tax economy in Manitoba. Well, question are they are they written in as a director? Uh, That's a very good question. The director has to be remember. Manito. Yeah. One of the we'll find out, i don't know. Your question rod is. You have to be a director for this program? No, no. Would that that? Like the question was about residency. If you're written in as a director, I don't think you have to be, but somebody has to be Our director has to be for Manitoba. So, If that makes sense for a match over company now, who knows what this program needs. My questions would probably be. What does it mean? What is it? Translate what is your dollar's translate into in terms of shares also? What is it? Translate What does it mean for your existing shareholders? That are pretty quiet. Very good questions. That's an excellent question. So the preliminary conversation team, which we we're going to invest on cash roughly about 10k to get a professional valuation made for the company. Uh, but we haven't paid this much but the preliminary conversation with the valuation. Uh said that our company roughly is worth this much. Okay, so Hope that gives you an idea, right? So, what if you? Invest. Yeah, so whatever you invest basically. So that do you guys are you know what that means? Maybe i'm happy to expand. I think it's self-explanation maybe it needs an example like Okay, so somebody says, great i got i'll do 25 thousand dollars of investment. What does that mean? Percentage wise Good question. So so roughly that's probably what would be maybe under five percent? Under five percent. But, you know, there is furthermore team, you know, because we are a small company and you guys have played a significant control to bring the company to where it is. You know, whether my advice or by being committed to what you're doing. Uh, We can work things out right, you know. So for example, if let's say 50k equates to 5 percent actually, let's do a quick number. Here you last 25k, right? Let me just see here. What does that equate? How to do the math for this. Let's see here. Times a five. So if you want to do a five percent, that would be 40k Based on this number. Okay, so 40k with equate to 5 percent, 25k would be probably less than five percent. We can, you know, if say you want to invest like, you know, to 25k. We can make something work. That may get it to popular present if that makes sense. So we can say, okay, well you you want to invest 25k Because that's what you have. And you think you want to keep your sort of restoration of five percent, We can look at maybe other intangible way to invest, right? Uh, one international way to invest, is really coming on Saturdays like this to, to Left the company, right to think of and strategically position the company in a good position. One of the intangible way to invest is to maybe spend some hours, right? And left to make sure the company is moving in the right direction. Why did we come on a Saturday, not on during the weekdays because there's fire supplies, right? It's impossible for us to have such a meaning while our customers servers are done. Or somebody's not able to get to the email or whatnot. So that's why we choose to sometime. Do a little bit of after hours and weekends. So that's intangible investment, right? So you could So if you can think about it this way, And i'm only like welcoming People, who, who really like i would want to say, I would want we would want to start a criteria of course as a team, if we were to purchaserate an awning piece of this company for who can also come in the future, but this moment we're very small that were not having so much of a criteria Beside of. You know, a bit of financial bit of commitment and better for good characteristics. And and, you know, you prove and you're proving yourself to to one or to take this company to the next level. The genuinely not not wanting to hurt or damage. This company. But yeah. Maybe we'll do a quick crown. So right. Any any questions comments? Good. Good questions. Yeah. Just what does it mean with the existing? Sure. There's other outside of Abdullah. Yeah, very good question. So that existing shareholders you've got muhammad and muhammad wants to exist. Certainly he has and just full transparency here with your team. Division. Right now is muhammad has 10 percent manage and has 25 percent. Abala has 65 percent. I'm i don't know why i have that many honest image. I'm the office manager of the company, i do between me and a dollar. There is a little bit of a cleanment that we sort of go on and we have this designer but i was like Steve Jobs. Okay, half percent for me and i wasn't taking any citizen when i when when the company was in the establishment process. Uh, and there were a bit of a complication for me to to own and And run the company, and also work towards my citizenship. So But that's a separate story. So basically, just, if you're curious of what the heck we are in, That's a special background. Yeah, so right, in terms of that other owners, Anybody could walk into those owners and offer them and they will. They will. Go out buy out, they'll pay they will sell. Yeah but there is but that's that's goes to their benefit they would get a capital game. The company would not benefit as much from the money. Uh, and they would get their shirts. So, that's one way. Of course for somebody. You could go and bargain. Hey mr. Muhammad, i know you have another boat and you want to sell out by your shares. All pretty much. They will sell their chance. That goes to a capital benefit to them. What we're trying to do here is is raise the capital benefit for the company so that we have a little bit of cash to Move the company followers. How can we do that when we we need to issue additional shares. Essentially, that dilutes. Everybody's Shares a lot. So if abdullah owns 65 percent, he would end up wanting. Maybe 62 percent. Mohammed. He would own maybe a little bit less, just because we're issuing more and we're increasing we're sharing that by with more people. Of the answers question, right? No. Absolutely. I wasn't sure if there was that thought up. Eventually you guys buying them out perhaps too. Well, you know, if i have the cash i would buy them out. I mean, sometime you would you would wonder, okay. What's the what's a good use of my cash at this moment, right? Yeah, it's well, i need to build the company. They're not impacting company negatively, though. They are interested in how many in particular is interested in. Selling magazine has lots to offer massaging. He's uh, Times on, makes it different. But imagine has been in cisco for 12 plus years, and his original management for sure is, is very wise, man. Very popular engineer. That's what you finished and he works in in an strategic sales and partnership. We have very limited amount of time with him just because of the time zone and how busy he is and sometimes also helps you are doing the week but the genre has lots of wisdom. So i'm not really eager to certainly offer him and you know, and he's also interested to give when he can Uh, so if we just open up the bridges of communication between him and us, he has lots to add to the table. As a matter of fact, That pricing that the hourly rate of our company and how it evolved and how we calculated. He played a really positive role in an impacting it initially before he joined, we were our hourly rate was advertised to be like 65 dollars or seventy five. And we used to always sell at 30 dollars in 40 hours an hour. And, And because we thought okay well if you know if my salary is 20 dollars an hour or 25, then if i sell for 35 and i'm winning but we did not see through that overhead. We never really calculated our overhead and our minute. So help us third he helped us create like i really nice exercise to show us. What is it? Truly costing us to sell the hour to do an hour of service to our customers and that blew my mind. And at that time, it showed us that we cannot sell below 85 dollars. That's like six years ago. Because if we sell below that we're losing, we're literally losing with a customer and And he opened our eyes and said, you guys are like, you're losing your your. So when you it's not like i thought at the beginning, oh, if i'm selling a little more than what i'm getting paid then then that's probably a profitable. But never you. So we were not accounting to the utilization. Because you're not 100, you're you're you're working 40 hours, but you're not necessary selling 40 of those hours. So many things did not were not accounted for and help us. So anyways, as young, a good gentleman and Uh, but yeah, if the right opportunity to to sell, he would absolutely sell now. Right. Any airports and we're john and and then probably sorry that i'll probably have to go right over here. But also what does that you know as a drop that criteria? What does it mean to have a You know, an active partner versus an active partner because i mean you're here really you guys are in the trench, right? And you've got two partners that aren't and that's probably, you know, it hasn't been a detriment but it's it's certainly not making it easier for you guys, right? So they know for other people joining, we want to talk to people somebody just showed up with money. Yeah they own a bunch but they're not contributing anything is that fair isn't who knows, right? Yeah because there is a You know have to keep in mind is a greater good here of trying to get funds back into the company, right? So Absolutely. Yeah. We at some point. As i mentioned, how much we'll get up. But but Mazin with their opportunity, he will also be willing to just because of the time zone, by the way. Just if you're curious Mazen, He has family here and he was going to migrate, but his migration our immigration did. All the owners by the working incidents, if you're curious. But imagine never made it to to live here. That basically, Uh, yeah, family challengers. And then it basically did not make him make it possible or feasible, so it is he's settled there. But his plan, he invested in a company because he wants to stay here, and he wants to play a role in company for it. Muhammad was here naturally, but he moved you to his work. Right. Appreciate your contribution and your your participation Do you think we should apply for this? Uh i think anything potential absolutely but i will say this, it really comes down to what you guys want to do. Right? If you're going to have an offer on the table of what that means, it's like How serious is that, right? Where do you guys want to be? And you know, three years right? Is it like you it's one thing to say, Yeah. Ideally we've got a company that's all across Canada and stream really well. Okay. Right. But if that's not the case, what do you want to want to do with Canada? How big is that vision of candy? If it is if it's something you can't bear to see your baby sold. Then go for it. You know what i mean? And and i sat it on some things that were about mergers and acquisitions and they said, You know, there's been at the table a few times trying to help an acquisition. And in the end. They couldn't sell that baby. Couldn't get rid of it. They wanted to see that play out to fruition and so so that's I don't think anybody in that in this room. Yeah. Pager. Well, that's a baby. Very, very bad and very good but i don't necessarily have an answer for it. What's i am one? Here is the word, is, if we Like in this network here are there. Okay. Can we uh is anybody interested in basically stepping up and taking a few steps forward? In. Owning a piece of the bar, is this a good thing even to do, right? Or So, i like the initiative that you asked, Everybody, like you said, Um, your plants making sugar, you know, for us to know where we at right now. Um, To applied stress in CBC. I think it's a good idea. We don't You know, we we I don't know, i would like to to Invest, but i'm not sure play a lot of Okay. Fair comment and we'll take it quickly. Handy. And travel. What's your comments? Yeah. Um, It's all very new to me. Yeah, hardly ever invested in anything, to be honest. And i don't have a whole lot of money to do. So it's not something, you know, it's not like that. I'm totally closed off from it and i have, you know, i have minuses my family. Okay support. But yeah. You know. I'm not necessarily opposed to doing so, but Just kind of finding how i can do that. That's that's why i'm, you know, it's very, very early, very young for you. And if i'm in your shoes, i would say. Oh, hey guys, you know, just barely starting to work here. So That's the fair comment. Thanks, thanks honey. Oh yeah, echo a lot. What he said there but yeah, i for sure. Be interested in. It definitely. I also don't have a lot of saved money too, to invest, but definitely would be interested for sure. It's a safe place where you want. Yeah, You have a minimum requirement for that. Yeah. That's what i want to know like minimum requirement for how much you have to invest that that might be determined by them. As much as you guys might have a mom a number in mind, but they might have some. Do you recall any minimum for that? I don't, i'll check. Yeah, they might, you know. Yeah, but can be either through them of course through them is there's an incentive but also, it can be outside of the program. Yeah. But that's, that's a good question. I'll check on the minimum and get get back here to everybody shortly. But yeah, that's that's great. I appreciate the question there. It's determined based on them john, i guess. And Uh, from us here. I mean we would welcome anyone who's genuinely interested. Of course, it doesn't make sense to do the all the paperwork and engage laws and whatnot for like 2k or 5k or 10k. I mean think it might be okay, sure starting now. But i think what rod mentioned there about the 25k, that's probably a good starting point. If you think that, you know, you would want to own a piece of the power, i want to control the company, this future and, you know, Do a sweat a little bit to take it even forward. What's our goal. How how much Finding our investment. We're looking for. As a company. I think that's a very good question about you. Excellent conversation here. I i think we would want to have like as a company to just take ourselves to the next level investing in some of these initiatives. We talked about here, And we want to raise probably about 200k as a company. We don't raise about 200k. And funding, whether it is from family, funding or some friends, and some other people like who are interested around here, And our, our promise to them. Is to hopefully return. 10 to 15 percent. And and i i do have some calculation that supports how we're going to get that 10. 15 percent back Uh, some of these calculations. Backed by the fact that i showed earlier but there are more in-depth calculation that tells you okay. I can see that enter 15 percent to come. So it's there is a lot of Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's it. Yeah. All right everybody. Okay, thanks a lot for lunch. Let's see a lot. Thank you. Stay in touch. Yeah. Have a good one. Um, yeah, i guess that. That's That's on that side. I would just give me one second. All right. Yeah. Maybe take yeah, you guys want to take a? I think it's a good moment to break. And then after the meeting will just flip the hats and get to the Tech aspect of things. Um, but yeah, if you guys have questions or want to converse further on this happy to share more insights, You know. They, they say, if you want to like be a Going to, you know, just Different lessons for people who want to grow their wealth, they say well you got to connect with wealthy people, right? You know go they want to go connect. What people ask them how can i help you? That's what you're asking. You don't tell them. Ask them for money, don't answer but you ask them. How can i help you, right? And For my network is very limited in in the city, right? But many, many others may have a little, you know, you got to ask these people who are quite well, how can i help you? What can i what what value can i add to you? And you know if you have some skill sets, you want to try to match your skill sets with their needs. And take it from there, so, You know, an invite. To connect with with your Lubricate, those networks, those connections with those And people. You might know of your networks. Have a little bit of wealth. And, and You know, get the name across right? Yeah, we want to build something great. And we want to keep it solid. We're gonna It's Now, there's lots to be mention here. I think, well, we'll take a pause and Except those, it's good to know them. Yes. Pretty good. Foreign. Don't worry about work. Yeah. All of us manage. Oh, I'm gonna smoke. No. Don't do it. So, that's okay. Ever been to a non-such, really? No, i haven't been there been a superms so christmas. It's what? I'm going there tonight. I think they have like, more games. Yeah, i pretty good things about it so but it was good to be carry. A few of my work. Yeah, we have the book three three weeks now. Wow, really? Yeah. Because we tried to do it a week in advance and then it was good. Then this kind of crazy, but Yeah. I've never been some. A lot of worker i don't. Two terms is good, though. That's probably one of the best best in the city. Probably. Yeah. One one big. Into one big city. One great city. Yeah. I don't know. Is that off of canister? Uh, no. It's Nearly pull apart. Definitely heard of camp picture pretty good. Yeah, i don't. I don't even really like like drink beer though like i don't drink too much, so I don't like it was the beer that we carry from. Uphills. But you guys think so far? Lots of surprises here. Oh, good information. Very good. Yeah. But that's a little more excitation stuff. Yeah, anybody's overwhelmed here, anyone is leaving the company, definitely a lot, but i learned, hopefully, we don't lose your Their fashion here or your that's the last thing. Or intent, my intention has To create from this. My name is good lots of stuff. I didn't know about. So, It's good to kind of give up. An insight on some things. I'm glad to hear. Any on your side. Information. Like sometimes it's good because sometimes i am skeptical about certain aspects and Financials. You know what my spa is looking like and that sort of thing. So That's, It's even for me like, when i was going through exercise of creating these slides, And i don't know what, i don't know, right? Because i'm not seeing this every day. Uh, in different places. So, So i look at this. Oh okay. That's not bad. You know, we're we have a good. Good figure here. We just need to know how to multiply this and Yeah, there are a number of strategies that were trying to To to bring and create to raise the bottom line. Yeah. Sales. It's one of the things that i certainly. You know, i want to Pursue it a little bit differently. As we grow. We want to multiply the effort that we do. In in sales. There is the i'll show you maybe guys something that's might be relevant. But uh, yeah, let's see here with Once once everyone comes back, we will switch how to just get to the jam and MDM stuff like Until everyone is here. I'm just gonna tell you guys what's something here. This is the fun yesterday. It was like two two servers that i went down. Oh really? It was it. Boxing issues. Yesterday was like that and believable. Yeah, it's fine. There's just there's Yes, they all is collectively that issues. They're once the right thing. Um, how did the vaccine thing though, actually? Yeah. The cold henry, for the fox saying, um, Yeah, we established our facts account. But the forwarding i ended up having to spend like an hour and a half or so with that just chasing different parties chargers initially. But then it's well and even with bell, i spent like an hour in the color or something. Just you it's crazy. And then i ended up being in a spot where they told me what that count is suspended. I said what the service is still running, like the they have internet. I said yeah, it's going to be interrupted, probably in the near future, but it's suspended, there is an overview on the count of eight hundred dollars. We can't start recording for you. So i sent an email to at some of the, it's an email to dollar told them. Well, he needs to get somebody to call. Yeah, they're not sure what the story is. What happened to Bradford? I think you worked on or dashboard One of the connectors we worked on. It's the same thing happening here as well. Right with their faxing. Yeah. So we need to just switch their boxes or fox. And because i was working on one of the i was working on that course clinic and you're working on Bradford. Pharmacy. Yeah. So i we needed to send a text and i ended up sending the tech to Danforth and it's a bit of a drive between both just created a more mess and i'll felt so about then it's like i said, okay? And like in the background, i was actually working on. Lots of tasks for hunting. And like, you guys saw this email, i was meant to really make some progress on it, so Like, yesterday, i may be part of 20 different emails or 25 feet or something but it certainly not what i wanted a day to go but i thought it's going to be slow but but it's all good there don't no don't care about it all you know so this is kind of funny it's it's where we are, you know it's that far like we're in the firefighting moment that's that's what. But yeah, it's we manage i guess we survived a day. It's you a good job. Driver there. Yeah, you did. At least we got. To crawl is back up and running a piece now. So the day is not over. Yeah. Yeah, that that's Which was okay. Yeah, we got Through it. Cuts here or whatever. Yeah, i think the most part for that you just get a contact the ISP. Here's the Contacts and difficult or sorry as our backs and they might give you the they just port the number for use that they're recorded. Yeah, stuff. The ported for that other location but that's like an involved process. Oh, it's not ported yet. Okay, i thought it is. Okay, no, it's green. It's being Forward that thing forward and definitely. And they recommended to do that for some reason. Okay. To look at it again. So, before we quickly switch the hat here, the team will talk about this. Uh, directory here. So recently, i found this site to offer. A huge business directory. To. Yeah, local for just basically have all the businesses in Winnipeg very much. Are in here and they are listed in a very nice way. Like they have a Here, we got. So they have like a different categories, right? It's like a, you know, it's a business listing. And my intention is to. And some businesses have names. Obviously you can see then the name of the owner, the name of the executive director, so when you call, you know who to speak with, My intention team. Is to contact everybody here. To generate interest. Uh, tell them who we are. What are we doing? Check on them. Approach it in the most. Positive possible way. That we can that that can allow for a conversation to take place. Uh, we will can create a script we can Go through it. The goal is not to sell them. The goal is not too. Get them out of contract. The goal is just to check on the businesses, right? As a company. As a as a local business here, we need to know how are the businesses doing around us. What are the challenges? What are the pain that are there? They're going through from a text standpoint or even from their business standpoint in order down? And if we are lucky, if we're lucky try to schedule them for A meeting with, with me. To basically talk more about their Technical challenges or problems. If they are not happy with their current technical provider. Uh, if they're happy, that's great. Check that box and spreadsheet or an assistant that we process will create. And if you are able to get their current, IT company, that's awesome. And then move on to the next. Um, After making like a few of those, it would start to give us an idea. Oh, okay. Well we see these are the successful companies in the market. Oh, these are the companies that are not successful. These are the businesses that are struggling. Then we start to you, might get an answer, a business say it says oh we are struggling but we're not interested right now. Alexa connect later on. Okay, well, you check that box right and Uh, we cannot know what we don't. No, without Reaching out, right? And we want to make this. Uh, We want to get to results really quick. At least, for For the next few weeks. So again, it's not very complicated. Just really calling. We can create a process. You're not there to close the deal. You're not there to close the sale. You're not there to even have all the answers. You're there to just see if there is interesting. If there is it just to connect just to connect note down these, we can create it. I'm going to be working on on this. An as i mentioned i do have a call. So next week with with a sales squash my first time having a code with her, i'm hoping for her to give me some ideas. I'll tell her that we're trying to do this in the team and advice. Working basically farm also and their theme. Just to raise that bottom line that i showed you in the numbers. Do you guys think you can help in this? If you maybe like once i'm not going to you, we still have customers to serve so we're not going to be able to stick an entire time. But i do want to still squeeze ourselves a little bit and push this exercise because We've been on it. We've been talking about for a while and we're not able to move it off the ground. How many customers did we have last month? Last two months, last six months, almost zero, right? We need to inject a few new customers or at least few opportunities on the table every month. Even if we don't cause them. But at least we know we're talking with them, right? There's something that's going to, that's expected to come down the road. But right now, if you ask me, what's coming down the road, i told you. Much. Maybe a little bit of clubhouse, whereas the working on that. And, but there has to be like more. Because you can see, it takes time like Up house, for example, you know, It's taking time for things to mentalize ladko company, right? It's taking time to materialize, we did that small call for them but But now there's nothing, that's so we need to have like a lot of these Yeah, i'm sure. Question. If somebody. Connect with us and what did a meeting? Do you have a specific time or day that you wanted to schedule those meetings? The simple answer to you Jonah is there's a link that you can book with me right? And you have that accessible a lot. Everybody can get could see this The the long answer we still have to work through a process, we still have to come up with our process from A to Z with you know. Okay you call there's a spreadsheet as it is a system. So we still want to fine tune that and i'm open for ideas and suggestions, but the simple answer I think there's a booking link, you know, you have it. And i think the team have it to That shows you quickly, that ability, you can put We can book anyone using that link, right? And, We take it from there. Okay, well Appreciate the positive intake, Trevor you have as well. Yeah. Okay. We can do this. We need everybody to participate. I think we need to, like, just like what we did today. Come together. We can even book their book this boardroom and we can just be called calling one after the other. And then we can just compete. Block for hours or so. Try to cross a number of names. Repeat this every week. And i'm sure we will start to see some really good names. Uh, okay, so my, then my homework is to start to do the planning phase of this, see how we're gonna orchestrate things, and, and hopefully you start to engage you Very soon. On what's next and notice something going on this list that just this shortlist that you're looking at here, every one of them got a custom website. Right. Like, think about that for a moment. What is that? What does that tell you, right? Like every one of them got Like dot mb.ca.ca.com, right? You know, yeah there's lots of them. Yeah, like and everything every one of them got a, got a phone number almost like a even a lot of them got faxes too like Like look at that, right? So and you guys i know some some people might be just another preserve site i thought that okay. Well, would i be interested intruding if i call whatnot? I actually looked it out the other day. The Canadian laws allow for cold calling Set for people on the do not call list. So what brings the government has developed a do not call list? And i'm trying to sign up so we can have access to it. Yeah. And so, in government, say, you're more than welcome to cold call, anybody unless they are on that, you know, who's on a do not call this. So i'm we're gonna have. So the access to that. Yeah, finalists. And then we'll just send them emails that Send you by mail. Yeah, do not call last canada. So, basically, they have got this and yes, but but then, now you're gonna be boiling the castle, the right? They can stamp hold her legislation. Yeah. There's another one. Cancel. Okay, or something? Yeah. So this is the, the do not call list and basically, i registered i'm waiting for their approval. And then they will send us a list that we can just basically double check if if we're calling our blessed or not. Um but again, what we're doing is not exactly that we're not directly selling, right? We're not calling to directly promote services. We're just having a check on the business. You're saying hello? Yeah, that's it. Yeah, even if they are listed, yeah, we're not like this is talking about telemarketers. Yeah, we're not telling marketers, you know, like it's not that's getting to know. That's it. We're just kind of local. You can like stand up, always having the green light to call like, you know, hey, we're your neighbor. Yeah. We're just having informal chat with them. That's where there's quality. If it's relevant, absolutely. It might not even apply. So we're trying to Kind of maximize. Are we gonna allocate any money for, for sales or like, are we gonna try different like methods or we just gonna go just through the book and call them? Because i know we push back the community center thing. I don't know if it's going to do that purpose like other communions of advertising electronics. I heard that you can face Canada, opposed to give away your flyers. You know, that for business to business. Right there, is that. So yeah, there are It sure. But like the, this process here. Like i wanted to get more real. I want to reach out to people. On a connect with the decision makers, the businesses that were eventually going to write, right? Right. So i would like to create a bit of a spike of that. It was in the next short while because we do, we are, you could say, we are and we're desperate for some really good customers. To raise that bottom line. So if you are looking at the time that i have and we have as a team versus and how much we could do. And what's the most effective thing to do? I would like to choose the most effective. If you tell me, it's sending the postcard. Is the most effective. I will tell you. Yes, let's do that. But if we were to less than a number of things and go through, what's the most effective? Is very costly driving and whatnot. I think it's very we can we can play it very smart when we head that And henry for the community center, probably we can do this in parallel as soon as we execute on this, a lot of it. I think we want to certainly have our because, yes, when you are called calling, especially you circle calling the surrounding so you can tell, hey, we're You know, we have established our presence that community center or Chocolate that way. And when we called call, i mentioned earlier, we could tell them what the manageable attack week. That's something cool to share with them, right? Many of them, may not know about it. And we actually are considering both sponsoring that myitoba tech week. We'd like to tell you what cost behind this. We're running also at the event. Perhaps we might run a training session during the native attack week. About maybe office apps. Or one note or productivity engine, right? Productivity, or maybe even LLM or tragibility use case or something like right, right? We still have to shape how that is gonna Look like okay. Well that's it team. I spoke for a lot. Thank you so much. Although i'm gonna pass to you lead us through the mdm and the avm and the jump or what we like to accomplish today. I think we have got the team maybe before another Hour and a half or so you guys are good for till five everybody. I believe it just like 4 30, but, okay, an hour and a half, so, how would you like to see and maybe we'll collaborate? Like, you know, maybe henry and travel also and i will participate with it. Yeah, i know that's good to sure. Do it. I gotta go thank you Joanna. Thank you so much. You know, like this? You need help, gonna put backing some things. Well, there is a lot, it take some take some That's, Yeah. Trash for the food. What do you want to do? What you want to cook next time? Just let me know that sport. Yeah. Well, you can. Yeah. What's the? Um it's like sticky rice but it's purple. It's like a dessert. Oh, it's called i think. This is sticky rice. And yeah, there is a different colors, too. Uh, it's just um, coconut milk anywhere. And goodness rates. Yeah. Yeah. Adjustment. Glutenants. Yeah. Goodness, it's fine powder. People. Yeah, made from rice. It's mainly rights, right? Yeah, yeah. Nice. It's like a sticky rice. It's a deserting. Yes, nice. There's a lot of piece of church. Number two, who's coming? On your most under most i, you know, i actually use it quite a bit for Spot checking scripts like posture scripts and also summarizing. So for example, i think i've showed you this guys this before like i would go Say like a youtube video like this and then i have a little chrome extension. Uh, it's called glass. I have another one here, called the chargeby summary, but what? Yeah, so what i do i actually Go like this. Um, I click AI summary or I can copy the transcript. So, if the video has been Has been uploaded in the last 72 hours. They won't be in transcript available yet. If it's a new video, you have to wait at least 72 hours for the transcript to be available. And then i go into all videos any video. So, any video that has been uploaded for at least 72 hours and youtube video, i grabbed the transcript. And then i go into open AI. And i say, Summarize the following, And, Five bullet points. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Thank you john much, appreciate it. Summarize the following and five bullet points. And then i just Paste it in, and i go like this. I don't know if i'm Doesn't look like i'm logged in my day or something once again. Cookies. Yeah, i'm just gonna And like, that's I understand the idea. Oh yeah that's cool. I'm just gonna log in. Yeah, i think i have. Yeah. So my google Yeah, so i go like summarize. So it's very good in summarization The following. Five bullet points. Uh, go like so. I don't know why i'm using 3.5, but It just defaulted and it gives me a summary of that video that youtube video. Yeah, technically i didn't really have to watch the video. You know what i mean? I mean i don't have to i mean the thing is what i do. I tend to actually summarize the transcript first, And then if something peaks my interest, i would go back and watch the video. You know so that way i can kind of again increase my productivity instead of watching one youtube video a day i can watch. Yeah you 10 i don't really watch 10 i summarize 10 you know what i mean. So Uh but, but so i went here for example, this morning And i and i in the comment section, i put a big summary. I commented with a big summary of that video. I find a lot of people actually don't know about this. So what i did, i use an add-on that connects to my chat, you get account called summarize. I click that that's slightly different adder. Gives me a big summary with with Relevant emojis with it. So i took that i just caught i like i copied that And i just put that in the comments. So next time, i watch the video, if i come across this video, i know that i've been here before. Right introduction just and you know, so i mean introduction just in founder of patch might bc he developed solutions. He worked as a former microsoft engineer. I don't need to know that, you know, i mean, but it's good. Yeah, it's a nice, nice to know but i can go in here. Setting up in tune, purchasing demonstration, purchasing new domain, via cloud flare. So, i'm kind of reading it before even watching the video. You see? He's another video, another example of Watching automating app deployment via gem with gem. So, i Watched a 50 minute video under five minutes. How did i do that? We charge of you summary, right? Right, so same thing. I went in here. Unfortunately this This youtube channel, they they turned off comments so i can end my own comment. But you kind of get the idea is that i'm watching these Long format videos and i'm learning quite a bit in a very short time frame. It's been and this is like the thing is, there's a ton of free material on youtube for any kind of topic, you think about And it's just, It's just, no, not enough time to watch all of them. It's just it's, it's not not, it's not practical, but yeah, but that's a good good question. Uh, Trevor. So, 900 was. Oh, this one, this is a I think this is like more azure Azure AI fundamentals. Yeah, yeah. There's actually a search for that. Well, that might be correlated to copa that you were talking about a i maybe that's more a German. That's like infrastructure LLM like islr, you know what i mean? Not not co-pilot. Yeah, yeah. But i see what you're saying, yeah. Um, So maybe yeah, maybe i'll head over to Just firefox over there where i have my i guess my Well, you know, it would be a good outcome of today. If all of us can do the jam 100 and get certified. Sure not now, yeah, it's just sorry. I just got that. That's a bit of an over maybe I and you have been going through it, maybe Henry you start because you have been actually going. You're the most committed to this. From us, i believe you've been putting some time, right? How is that going for you? That's really well. More. So i haven't actually Like dive into jamp as much and the different features and stuff that they offer. A lot of it is like a good refresher on iOS and Mac OS and and it just the terminal and introduction scripting. And it gives a kind of a little bit of a deeper dive on. The operating systems as well. So i'm refreshing myself on that first and foremost. And then it will get into gentlemen. The different things that it offers. Makes sense. So you would say, would you say that you're halfway maybe through this? Materials. Yeah. Okay. Um, for a timeline monthly, trying to think you like a month, right? Because those things, but John 400. There we go. Depends how quick you would take a month. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Oh, because there still is a lot of information that goes through. I was thinking we could just all get certified today. Well, i mean, i don't know i guess it's not processary. I just throw 100 bucks at it and see if you You know can pass or whatever? I think you need 75 to pass. Okay. Yeah i guess that's true. That's a good point. Yeah, waste of money. Yeah. So Actually, on that note, don't pay 100 bucks. We have promo code. So, and she can give us. If you guys wouldn't like too many go through one today and to just get an it just one, of course, can go and then we all as maybe that's a good use of time because she said she can give us as much as we need. So do you guys want to try like all of us challenge one? At the same time, we was one. Maybe okay. What's your plan about for the next? Yeah, right now and just give it a chance. See, what kind of questions they have and how would they have to prioritize it? Okay. So maybe they fail hard or we barely pass or i don't know. No, i don't know how long the exam is but i do you roughly. What do you anticipate? How long would see it? Being longer than 25 minutes? I would agree. Okay. You want to try them out challenge the exam. You can challenge it as many times, so as you will be rough for Is it going to show on my resume? If i feel, i'm just kidding. That's a good one. No, i'm just kidding. I'm just Okay, so let me try to find out how to go through the exam process. Then you scroll down the pages to say get started. Oh you are there okay yeah that should be an exam get started, right? Introductions. Okay. About the exam. I don't want to make them to schedule it or there's a practice example. Okay. A practice exam it's wise to go through our practice examples. Yeah. Select iOS apps exist in a self-contained environment, called an app sandbox, true, or false true. But how do i select that? Like is there a just a guess, you know? It's oh, okay. So answer is having a lot. Maybe then open up a new tab, just with the answers and then we'll put. Yeah. One where here? Just open a new town. Oh, And, I think that shows you that answers. Right? Okay, so let's go back now. Okay, so i'm beginning to do that. Okay, so let's see how swiping down from the top right on? An iOS will access which feature your control center. Well, Proud that, you know, swiping down. Oh, that's the iphone. Okay, top right? Yeah, right control center. I think they mentioned that but i forgot about that. An apple id is required to complete iOS setup assistance. True. No, it's not required. No sports. Okay. So you can complete that setup set without an apple, you don't need an Apple ID, you can bypass it. Interesting, i'll get, you know, Yeah, i guess they want to make it, make it accessible for most people, right? Along with apps which features can be added to them. It's wages. It widgets sorry. No, that's why i'm the only iphone user. I don't know anything. So which feature can be added iOS home screen, that gives acts edition Okay, you guys guess. Yeah. Like world clock and batteries. I think we're just yeah. Complications with the hand, the delete an app from an iOS device. Touch and hold or navigate a settings or use the app store or app cannot be deleted. Touch, and hold. Correct. Yeah, that's like android. Like that's pretty much, right? Under which section the settings generator user. Be able to update the name. That is device. The name of the device. I would say under the about, correct. Come on guys, that's easy. I'm just gonna semias apps. Allow users to purchase additional features. What is noted next to the get button? In-app purchases. Addition features. Yeah it literally, they're called in-app purchases, right? These are pretty easy, actually. This is well, yeah, this is not even on jam flow. This is just oh, okay, that's just iPhone. Just like general information. 100 is about done pretty much. It's like an entrant to iOS also, but there's like, scripting and the terminal. That's like, you know, it's just the apple. Okay, so that's the second one is more macOS. Let's go backwards and then it'll have jam stuff too. Like, it'll have to have to push it update. When i have a user can opt out of sending app analysis, crash it add development be doing is set up assistant true. I think they want to respect your privacy section to macOS core property list. Oh, i just read about that this morning playlists. It use which file extension p-list. That's it. See actually it's more in the advanced like custom configuration policy but you have a back, you know? No, no i actually did what that in a video today. I actually, you know, i barely use the smack to be on. Trust me, i like like most of the week. I'm using my, my windows, which commands can be used to reveal the contents of the macOS directory in the command line interface. Contents of a directory. Yeah. LSU right. Cd, it's it's the navigate and make directory is to create a new folder. Cp is to copy. Copy. Okay. Yeah, ls is the list, which is yeah, which is the right, right? Answer. Which character represents the current user's home directory in the command line interface, Or the the tell? No, i don't tell Dar eslash the current Fluency, i believe it's, it's Ah, that's a good one. Either a or c, probably c, right? See Internet can actually require to set up a Mac false. No false, right? There's a little. What's up falls? So you said to set up a mark not to And roll it into mobile into jam, right? So to set up, you don't have to have Wi-Fi, right? You don't have to have And no. Or is it true switch back to the answers? Let's just confirm. Yeah, that's a good one. Three. Inapper penis. I told you, okay? And three is is a slash quickly. No. Oh yeah. Get the fourth one. Let's see if possible. Yeah. False foreign action? Yeah. Because it's not autopilot, it's just set it up like just like BYUD, right? Which is the following is content in a macOS Apple menu. Finder. Apple made like this apple menu right here. This is the apple menu shift. Command option, space, command space. What the no, no. That's your skip. The question about it. No, i'm looking at the question. I'm just looking at my menu here for reference. So that's not spoiley's. Ball is when you search for stuff, the system preference. Oh. Sorry sorry. Sorry. My bad apple menu finder system preferences. Yeah.
