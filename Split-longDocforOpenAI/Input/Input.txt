Speaker 1   00:00
And here to add value to the businesses to move them from a tob. Example. Any disagreements on the choice support that any does that drive echo? Okay, perfect. So that's that's kind of the computing and that's what we we are. Now we have evolved over the years. This is here just a brief timeline. Of how the company has started. And where are we? Our are we at today? And where are we headed? So, And 2014. The company was incorporated. Officially When pretty much this is late, that here i graduated from the ROC polytech. From the electronic engineering program. In 2015. Spider in the company on a full-time basis. Prior to that i had a full-time job as an embedded system developer. With a local company here that it's called presentek the manufacturer systems for vehicles. To forget a logging, so it's It was a good job. It was a tough decision to to really make that. I just to switch full-time to the company, or yeah, it was A decision that i spend about 10 days contemplating on and i can certainly dive in details there if you guys are interested, but that's not obviously the goal of this meeting. And 2015. Also as a was a video for us, you know, it's uh we got a really good project with the RBC or the back of Canada and collaboration with IBM. And to basically migrate To three thousand computers. So, from Windows, XP to Windows 7, excellent project. Lots of hands-on, and Uh, really kicked off the the year and and the commitment there on a good note. Also, we have got a really A good project with mogul, financial institution. Uh, it's a local Canadian credit card company if you guys haven't heard of it, Before it's based on vancouver, they were establishing their second call center in in the And the country and they had it in one of like, so it's It was, i don't have still there. I those pumping, something they moved past, i wonder if they are still there. They are they weren't exchange district. So we helped them build the, the foundation, the low voltage, the switches the, then the entire network stack, Running. About 500 cables or so in the call center and was a really good project that's in 2015. And of course, You know, over the years here, i'm just mentioning the highlights the key highlights, but since we started, we are an IT company, you know, and prior to even 2014 slightly that's when we onboarded best western downtown benefit. And we help them in. Migrating their exchange server from SBS to to To 2008. We

Speaker 2   02:49
Always have. Who is the second? The second full-time employer.

Speaker 1   02:53
Excellent question. So Singapore, time employee was a gentleman named android and report. No, and he's working for microsoft right now. Uh, he was the very second person that we hired on a full-time basis and And really help the company you work with us for what a year and a half. And Uh, was excellent person. He graduated from the RFC politic from the BIT program and Did an excellent job in these very driven man. And And yeah, he's now working at Microsoft, he's in vancouver. Um, And yeah, so in 2016, we had Our first investor in the company. He showed it interests. They started were growing. They they Uh, they wanted to be part of what we are. What our first official office in 2017, that's when we established our relationship with microsoft. You guys know it's no doubt it's the bread and butter of what we do. It's a key partnership that we have in place and and we Are growing with it. We want to keep maintaining it. We want to keep our skills, sharp around it to continue excel. Excellent. In 2018, we had another major project. And that's a network upgrade for. Many, many hotels across the country, it's for the best western. So we've done network upgrade for about 100 plus hotels. From east to west pretty much, many of them we travel to And many of which we also are cloud contractors for and it was done in two stages. A stage one is to do an assessment. Understand what's existing take that information plantings out and then Lots of coordination with so many key players. And and then schedule the upgrade to take place. Usually, about a month or two after, Uh, so we participated in that. If you're interested to know more about any of these talk to me, i'm happy to expand and tell you and even show you some Some more information a lot, really lots of potential and that project A grew organically we want that project organically just from our relationships for the local Best Western. So we started with the very first Best Western in downtown United Bank 2013 from there. The order of mouth started to dry and we got other best western and then Best Western on Pembina. As some of you guys know, they are the governor, they are the governor for all the best Western in Manitoba. So they oversee any new best western, they do the inspection for them. And they played a key role in securing this relationship with the international. With the best western international organization in the states. Uh, Next here. And 2019. As you have no apologizing, the organization on a full-time basis. Um, We he helped in automating many of the financial aspects prior to that we were doing a lot of manual work when it comes to sending invoices and whatnot. Done, a really good job there in automating. Many of that. And, Let's see here. What else is the key points to mention? Yeah, in 2020. That's the covet year. We uh the company we are three talented people. Uh, who Some of them are still with us and, you know, some are not but It was a good year. New major point in healthcare. Uh, we got support from both of governments as well as establishing a specialization in the technical team, a little bit as, you know, we're small team. So i'm kind of point at some of us here. So as you guys know, you know, Trevor is holding the network area, this is a special team, right? It's no longer. Uh, just every Yeah, it's it's that sort of an henry of course is in charge of the support arm, we take chart, we we take Uh, and we help each other right in that we sometimes take turns on these roles. It's not meant to be for one, person only or or so. And the goal that vision is to grow that person to a team in the future as well until we are there, we have to continue to support each other as a small team here and And collaborate that were possible. 2021, we federal incorporated the company, we establish our advisory board, which we want to really Uh, get get back into. Activated a little more. We just have been so busy in the last few years that we have been able to do much. But yeah, establish a great team of advisor advisors Thank all your art is also. That's where we start the ownership with rod being on advisory board first. And there are a few key people there that we certainly would like to engage in and learn more from and update them on where we are at. We switch our accounting firm which we are also probably enemies switching one more time this year. Uh, they haven't been able to just catch up and just been a chaos to be honest, but that's just another That point a point for another discussion in 2022, we doubled in revenue as a company. We expanded to the smart park area. Where we are at today. And, Yeah, in 2023, our company and maybe some of you may or may not know, we became acidic advisor. We are registered with the government of canada as a As an advisor, the advisory company i am on that. Role and we'll try to open it up as it gets more traction but it is moving slow, to be honest, but we do become a C diff advisor. See that if you don't know what it stands for, Anyone know that everybody knows what sidades you know, giana probably right. You know this as well. Trevor Henry, i don't know, i don't know. Yeah. So it's it's basically starts what? Canadian digital adoption program. It's a program from the governor of canada that gives businesses. Uh, up to 15k in funding. To work on their digital adoption plan. So it's any small business in here. You think about they are interested in in maybe creating a plan to see where they're headed, they may very well qualify for this program and through that program they can see who is registered there and they can pick And they can work with that partner. Um, and what we do is creating a plan for them, looking at what they currently have their business objective and And try to see what technology could help them get to where they want. So basically the funding covers, the planning only, it doesn't cover the implementation. Uh, that's where they can be qualified to. Uh, that's where they can qualify to another funding from the bdc It's It's a, it's a basically, a Canadian bank owned by the government that gives them funding to To basically execute on that plan, they give them up to 100k. In and funding. But that's, that's a loan, basically, it's not a grant. So the the cdap gives up to 15k of grants, the bdc would give them up to 100 certain amount roughly Depending on their business size, but it does go up to 100k. And and that's alone you have to pay back. It's what's nice about it. It's an interest-free loan.

Speaker 2   10:21
Yeah,

Speaker 1   10:21
Up to five years and they can return. Okay, so they don't have to impact their cash flow to implement. That that plan. So Uh so yeah, lots from the government of course to get get good with technology. The people just have to know where it is and we have to know how to fit and and how to to plug ourselves. So we can also play value there. Our goal as you guys know last year and also this year is to do more with less as well, right? Is learning how to leverage our, our key people and our our key resources around us from tech and whatnot to really do more with less. It's Uh, we've been over the years, you know? It's always an investment growing, a business, always an investment. There's always that, you know, we have to Uh, you know, invest in an office, for example, and then hopefully it will get Utilized in the near future. We have to invest on a computer by computer as a person. And then slowly you'll start utilize it. And and then you have to invest in people bringing the right people. And then hopefully, slowly. They Can be more engaged, more. Uh, more so driving the business and driving the The commitment to our customers. So it's always an investment. But, you know, at some point you do have to Come and say okay, we'll be invested in something. Let's let's now try to make sure we are leveraging everything that we have invested in and let's make sure we are. Uh, truly building, not just spending our wheels or not, not just staying in location A or not. Moving to be And so on and so forth. And we have You came a long way since we started the company. I think lots of You know, all of this is just achievements, right? We went also be more. Uh, when it establish an internal. The transparency accountability, some of this you guys have seen through the time tracking through what we what we have been doing, which sending those reports on a weekly basis to everybody even engaging the investors and the people are interested. Uh With more transparency showing them. Okay. Where are we at from numbers perspective? And where are we headed? So that's that's a little bit of time like that. Maybe i'll pause for a moment here. Again this is really the goal of this is to engage in discuss. Uh, share interests. Any questions and comments? By losing anybody's. Attention. All good. Yeah, that's why i'm giving me the Thumbs up there. And i'm

Speaker 3   13:02
Wondering if in this, like Presentation, i, we have the previous like achievements and stuff, but do we have like a road

Speaker 2   13:07
Map for a future of like where we want to be in the next following year? And you know,

Speaker 4   13:11
Very good, very good question, happy. Yeah.

Speaker 1   13:13
All right, excellent. Uh, the last couple of slides, we'll talk a little bit about some of the things that we want to achieve or what we want to focus on. Uh, depending machine Jump. Yeah, so there are a few and the last few years like there are a few points but what excellent point? Yeah. That's Uh i'll try to scam to the next slide here quick so that we can hopefully get to them. And because circling the goal is to To. Yeah, the future is so that's that's you know we want to know what's the past. We want to know our ad today. What we certainly want to know what are we headed? Um, you guys know our mission statements to provide provide the highest level of hockey service to our value clients by carefully. Assisting specific needs. We always start with assessment knowing what they have. And and delivering customized solutions using the most advanced and appropriate systems available in the marketplace. And this is just a symbolic cloud. I put it there for some of the people who, you know, get to see the company, it just reflects that the company has evolved, you know, there were a few stages at the very first logo, we had the company is that and then we engaged some professionals to help us improve and then that's we ended up with that with the final logo. So there is a lot of gives you. Yeah. The company not just start yesterday or a year before. You know, there's been a bit of Of changes and and evolution there. Uh, we care the most in this company. As people as founders and as even staff and whatnot about the relationships, Between our staff. Our vendors, our partners. Our customers most importantly, Uh, these relationships are key to us. We every one of them, it took time a lot of time to build and establish that trust. So our goal is to really continue on building those long-term relationships. Uh, good relationships. And and yeah. So we have an industry leading client and staffing interest rate. It makes us the number one choice for for the

Speaker 3   15:23
Customer

Speaker 1   15:23
It needs. Uh it might it is something we want to continue nurturing for sure. Many of the companies that work like, you know, the surround computers, for example, and others, they come to they gotta gotta start to fire customers. How do you part of? Like, you know, it's it's we we took us time to build a connections. And relationships. How do you like you know many many of those bigger sort of opportunities they come and tell you all you have got a fire desk and done and that it's not it's not it's something you want to get better at perhaps, maybe at making sure the right people are around. But but it's something you know it's not easy for me to do and well thank

Speaker 2   16:02
You're not if they're still cycle there. Like that makes sense. When you're, you know, Negative capacity, right? But yeah, you still have cycled. Why not keep it everybody happy, right? So and Again, they're trying to say, You know, in their world of greed. They're trying to keep everybody at a profit margin of this week. You might have a customer that you only make this app. Get rid of them. Yeah,

Speaker 1   16:27
Wait

Speaker 2   16:29
We can still help them.

Speaker 1   16:30
Yeah, so

Speaker 2   16:32
I agree with

Speaker 1   16:33
You. That's yeah, the balance there is certainly something we need to learn how to do. And and yeah, there is a lesson learned there

Speaker 2   16:42
For sure. And that's a it's that somehow you want to Keep a few really good customers rather than a bunch of. You know, at a whole bunch of bunch of headaches.

Speaker 4   16:53
Yeah, headaches right, right,

Speaker 1   16:54
Right.

Speaker 3   16:57
Absolutely. I

Speaker 1   16:59
I think it's Yeah. I i certainly need help in that. Absolutely because As you mentioned, we took us time to build these images. But how do you announce, say, well, listen, you know, it's i really appreciate this and all of that, but we're now

Speaker 3   17:14
Then

Speaker 1   17:15
Yeah, it's keep remembering where we came from and how we got there. Feel free guys. Whoever wants to be the hammers.

Speaker 2   17:30
Oh, it definitely is a case by case base, it takes a lot of assessment, right?

Speaker 5   17:34
Because you have to let go, there's nothing.

Speaker 1   17:39
So you guys know what we offer so i'm not gonna maybe well it's worse, i guess refreshing so got services around workstations services around servers and some others around networks and cloud. You guys think this is it's still true should be adjusted do we should be welcome other services here or other categories? Is this? Digestible, when it's presented that way. Let's start taking your opinion quick since everybody, i will change workstations perhaps

Speaker 3   18:10
And

Speaker 2   18:11
Point or customer claim. Find what is this? Something like that

Speaker 4   18:15
And points? Yeah,

Speaker 1   18:16
We're taking notes, right? I am taking notes. Yes. At least call me.

Speaker 2   18:22
Yeah.

Speaker 1   18:22
But if i could ask about those measure changes like that. It's highlight them. So we really act on them because yes, and user compute and user computer. Okay, I love it, that's great. Will adjust that. The rest, you guys think it's, it's It's reflects what we do is there anything that? Is not shown there, but we actually work on. And we should have.

Speaker 2   18:50
And licensing.

Speaker 3   18:52
When

Speaker 2   18:53
You think that, you know, there's how there's companies out there that have issues with Got too much strong. We don't know what it started. We had you know, we had We have three things that we buy that are doing the same thing. Can you is there some sort of licensing? You know, review of that right? And i don't know where we fitted

Speaker 3   19:14
Them, right? And

Speaker 5   19:15
It's good i think to put in microsoft too because as i've been searching before, like i Done in my searching on those. Different companies. I always need microsoft there. Okay. On their Solutions. Microsoft partner, efforts. So people will be affected to it, because everybody knows microsoft right? When you have sites for partners, right? We have like logos

Speaker 1   19:43
I we have one in the in the proposal, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2   19:46
We used to look like i removed it.

Speaker 1   19:49
Oh, all right. I remember we used to have it right or not. I yeah was it not that relevant to investment or investors? I guess?

Speaker 2   19:57
Yeah.

Speaker 1   20:00
Bitcoin john logos. Um What if we speak with a customer? That's Apple. Significant with apple, right? How do you?

Speaker 3   20:11
I'm not sure,

Speaker 5   20:12
But i just i just see the SEO later.

Speaker 1   20:15
Okay.

Speaker 5   20:16
Search engine optimization, so i see. What other? Other companies are doing on their websites so

Speaker 1   20:25
You can add apple, like apple logo.

Speaker 2   20:33
Without architecture partnership or

Speaker 1   20:36
Not apple. I just

Speaker 2   20:37
Technology buckets, right? Yeah,

Speaker 1   20:44
We can say microsoft's cross platform

Speaker 2   20:46
But i think that's a better thing, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3   20:48
Or like something like, uh, almost like user solutions. Like a lot of this. If they have, like a large corporation with a lot of employees, they're looking at this like, hey like what is the interaction day-to-day with actual people and what do you do for them? Because like, a lot of us is actually just really To people with issues, they have or like user life cycle, different access management, stuff like that. So something that's All encompassing for actual kind of people and what they'll see day-to-day like, that would be a good thing to throw in

Speaker 1   21:15
There. And

Speaker 2   21:15
I think along those things lines of what you're getting at is. So how do you process an automation, right? And that's when you say tech enabler, Having processor automation is such a buzzword everybody wants. Some degree of automation, they don't know what but that's that's one of

Speaker 5   21:33
Those are keywords. So i'd

Speaker 2   21:37
Just say where did the where do those fit into current buckets there. Right?

Speaker 4   21:41
Automations good. You want to add here and

Speaker 1   21:44
Do we do a lot of automation?

Speaker 4   21:46
Well, depends where i like, i mean, i do automation,

Speaker 1   21:49
Right?

Speaker 4   21:49
Like, i mean, I think trevor's is doing automation

Speaker 1   21:52
But

Speaker 2   21:53
It's almost the that that assessment.

Speaker 1   21:56
Yeah, like

Speaker 4   21:56
Network wise, right?

Speaker 2   21:58
So

Speaker 1   21:59
Tell me more How are you automating? Like like i

Speaker 4   22:03
Don't know. Log shipping logs, right? Okay,

Speaker 1   22:05
I

Speaker 4   22:06
Don't know. You're automating that

Speaker 1   22:08
In a way, right? Like, you know, Like,

Speaker 3   22:14
Backing up data, or Automating that okay, okay.

Speaker 6   22:20
Automation. Would you?

Speaker 2   22:23
You probably have it all over and you're just not even thinking like, oh yeah,

Speaker 3   22:28
A lot of the solutions like that and stuff. I feel like um, They can all kind of dip into each of these in a certain way so i don't know. Like more maybe something that's like easily digestible with someone who you know wouldn't be able to name. Okay. What is a cloud solution?

Speaker 5   22:43
Yeah.

Speaker 4   22:44
Like when we push out apps, right, like policies. Like like, i mean, trevor can go in and push a policy out to all the firewalls, right? Right.

Speaker 2   22:53
And i think, Thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 1   22:57
All right now to all the power. Not at once again

Speaker 3   23:00
But

Speaker 2   23:01
If you have it but it aligned to it take a neighbor

Speaker 1   23:03
Sure. Uh okay superficable, absolutely i love it. This is great. So maybe licensing and automation we talked about those two Uh, yeah, we'll add them

Speaker 2   23:14
And licensing might be a very Minor one, the automation i think, is much bigger because

Speaker 5   23:19
Exactly it

Speaker 2   23:20
Really gives a Like let's face it, these are all things.

Speaker 1   23:24
I

Speaker 2   23:25
Put the most part about a company and gloated by. Hey, they can go buy their own microsoft Office, right? But hey wait, how do i need it all together? And some of that whether it's animation or implementation,

Speaker 1   23:39
Solutions. Right. That's About the microsoft. I'll perhaps start to add that slide back again about the partners. And it's known secret that we, we cannot do this ourselves. We we with partners. Is how we establish and how we, how we get there. And certainly, we have strong partnerships with microsoft Fortinet And ether and few other key players that help us develop, and develop our services in these different categories that Uh, so so absolutely I think it's so into other that slide again. Okay this one here just gives everybody here a little bit about how we know we evolved we obviously from really the beginning. There we had a technique system in place. So we looked at how many tickets we resolved since the beginning as profitable 13 thousand plus. It's also, it gives you an idea how we grew and, you know, could say you could see that, uh, within constantly growing, it's not like You know, maybe a little bit of a depth here in 2021 but then it follows with it with really busy appeared in 2022. Uh, we did in 2023, i guess. Mainly because of the spikes that we had from FGC and a few other key customers. And then things have slowed down. A little bit and 2020, but You know, hopefully 2024 will Product seed, both. Uh, but yeah, so that's that's that. I

Speaker 2   25:08
Like your. What is your your squiggly line underneath the 13 thousand tickets? That's what i'm usual. Oh yeah. Is it based on the bar? Right.

Speaker 1   25:20
I i'm trying to talk about, you know what, this is a good question. That's

Speaker 2   25:24
Unusual.

Speaker 1   25:25
It's

Speaker 2   25:25
Just yeah, but it's like what i oh yeah, i

Speaker 1   25:30
Use the automation actually, in the park.

Speaker 2   25:33
They're design. Tab. Okay,

Speaker 1   25:38
Not copa is quite yet there but yeah, it suggested that i use this line so

Speaker 2   25:43
Well.

Speaker 1   25:45
Okay

Speaker 2   25:46
So does it also a highlight here somewhere in the next slide? It shows that henry close six thousand of those.

Speaker 1   25:53
Oh yeah, yeah. So look at this. Here they are.

Speaker 2   25:58
Alex

Speaker 1   25:59
This next slide. Indeed have a little more.

Speaker 2   26:01
I got one. Yeah,

Speaker 1   26:02
I

Speaker 2   26:03
Got one, right.

Speaker 1   26:07
That's cool. So Yeah, this one here gives

Speaker 2   26:11
Us.

Speaker 1   26:12
Rod

Speaker 2   26:14
Was that the end request. A requested. Uh yeah i sold that that level three potion and which was

Speaker 1   26:21
Everquest the game that we're talking about. Yeah. So suffix boundary to Islamp q. Just showing the other response time in the team and then the average resolution time for ticket. I'm sure the key people in the company who's, you know, really working in the team and If you want to, Ask any questions about any. So let's just give you a slide. About that. Let's see here call to highlight that the busiest hours of the year. Is usually between nine and five or nine of four? No, no, no, no, no. It's obvious why i guess. Uh, so like one one pm looks like to be the busiest, you know, it could sort of read different kind of data from here depending on how you like to just see it one day, for example, is the busiest day of the year. So this is really that's an average right from the 2023 years. Another slide just tells you briefly what the company is busy with most of the time apple, lots of apple one apple, one micro 365 services red and butter and we have yeah. Okay i like yeah i guess you you can always decide you want to be at the top 10 percent. You could be a tough to percent of the bottom or the highest

Speaker 2   27:43
Exactly. That you're leading the leading, the worst. Yeah.

Speaker 1   27:48
Yeah. But uh, that's actually cool to look at. Okay. What are the lowest services that we do? But yeah. So 361 networks are the the major To service categories here. Uh, printers are still a fair amount of work there. Uh, let's see here. I'd like to tell people that were exceptional. We our team of amazing technologists that we are here to help grow and learn and, you know, keep things moving forward. Absolutely

Speaker 2   28:19
Electrician.

Speaker 4   28:21
Uh,

Speaker 2   28:22
I know you're using the sounding thing about it. I'm thinking like central gas or something. Yeah, sniffing, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Not sniffing the networks. Yes, sniffing something else. Yeah,

Speaker 1   28:36
We need your picture Henry here. And john, right. I don't know if you like to have architecture your picture. Yeah, i would love to So from time to time, we would come just like what where we are today for weekend, lunch and learn. We love to do, more of them, not easy to organize, what Just to keep our knowledge in check and and synchronize what we know as a team. Um, As a team. As a company, we share a number of core values. It was brings us together what we value. Those the most and we value so many others as well. Uh, i want to take perhaps a moment with new team to To China with these briefly and see if perhaps there are, maybe one or two. We could add as a result of of the today's meeting. Uh, you know, traveling probably guys, remember when we very first established, this we sat down together, we tried to brainstorm what makes sense, and as a core value for our company, and And yeah, so we no doubt. I have a high level of integrity as a team. I have a an extreme level of honesty. I wouldn't, i want to say and i would love to I hope to continue to certainly keep all of these. Uh and check we have a good level of humility balance with competency always, you know, when you bring humility to the table, you want to make sure your ring competent people to the table. Uh, but they're not sort of people who are bragging or, or arrogant sort of speak. There are people who have a good level of competency but they, they can share that and talk about it in a, in an approachable. Good way to to other people. I want to drive excellence. We want to continue to always drive, excellence drive, excellent, the value to our customers. The moment we seize to offer value or add value that's when we seem to exist. That's when the relationship will automatically start to just sort of die. So we want to continue maintaining these strong core values as a team. And, and certainly, we want to There are so many more that could be added for sure. But i would love to as a, as a result of our today's meeting. To certainly add one or two more, at least. So Let's open it up your team. Let's, let's take. Your ideas, your thoughts about, About. If you're really feedback for us on these, if they should be changed and then maybe at least one or two that we could add. Forever.

Speaker 3   31:06
Yeah, i'm just curious about what you mean about like the the value. I don't think we have that one when we did it

Speaker 2   31:12
Initially. Like, do you mean like individual value?

Speaker 3   31:15
Like as Person brings your own value or

Speaker 2   31:18
I guess value. Here is the appreciate this because if it's

Speaker 1   31:22
Not confusing, then it may not be very clear to many people as well. So it looks like me try to work on that but the goal of this is Adding value to customers, right? So capital as part of our core value as a team we always continuously one up add value to the table. Right? When we are at a problem when a problem is presented to us when a meeting where i'm eating as a company, as a team, as people. We are not going to come here for just. These egg of looking at each other replaces, or we're gonna come here to add value right? When the customer and buys us to that table, we will for sure add that

Speaker 2   31:57
Right. I want to ask Jonah. What do you, maybe? That wouldn't value.

Speaker 5   32:09
Giving value to the company also and giving value

Speaker 2   32:13
To the customers as well. Do you like the word?

Speaker 1   32:18
Yeah, but definitely what you think.

Speaker 2   32:21
If you think like in a, i'm kind of wondering if we because i don't get to the A good value here mean. Like i know where we're trying to strive for is that we're seeing as being Value

Speaker 5   32:35
Valuable to

Speaker 2   32:37
A customer and that there is You know, legitimate reasons to keep the relationship. But i look at and go think about it, you know, almost out of your question goes. Value. We change the word, bargain. Was that is that something we want to maybe pull out bargain? Cheaper something like that. Dude, we want to kind of just say okay great that the rest of this comes with that.

Speaker 3   33:05
I didn't look at it that way but i could see how someone could make that assumption maybe. Yeah.

Speaker 5   33:10
That

Speaker 3   33:10
We're trying to prove something that you know but

Speaker 1   33:13
I

Speaker 3   33:14
Don't know. I mean, i look at it as we're, you know, returning on their investment of having the relationship with us and like any issue will be resolved to ensure that they're

Speaker 2   33:23
That they're kind of 100%

Speaker 3   33:25
Capacity for running with business. Yeah,

Speaker 2   33:27
That's, that's great.

Speaker 3   33:28
I mean, you could find another synonym that maybe.

Speaker 1   33:32
Let's, Let's take a quick watch. Should we remove this? Or is it ambiguous, or should we keep it or should we change it to as anonymous world? What

Speaker 2   33:42
Else would we add? Let's try that,

Speaker 1   33:44
What else? Yeah.

Speaker 2   33:45
Okay,

Speaker 1   33:45
Let's let's keep a brainstorming, uh, session quick here on this starting off confidence, whatever comes to mind,

Speaker 2   33:53
Confident confident,

Speaker 5   33:56
Um, dependable.

Speaker 1   33:57
Dependable.

Speaker 2   33:59
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3   34:00
Really reliability. Depend up there with.

Speaker 1   34:05
Okay, let's let's keep it coming and we'll choose i'm sure too function.

Speaker 2   34:10
Okay? Uh, He wakes it on because i don't believe in that.

Speaker 1   34:16
Innovation.

Speaker 5   34:17
What can we put

Speaker 2   34:18
Innovative? Yeah,

Speaker 5   34:20
Yeah.

Speaker 1   34:23
Okay. Let's see. Yeah. One from On your side there on on

Speaker 4   34:30
Mine's side. That's a good.

Speaker 1   34:32
I think you mentioned one time about you mentioned one that you wanted to add always he said mission i would love to

Speaker 2   34:39
Oh

Speaker 4   34:39
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. A tenacious

Speaker 2   34:42
Diligent. Yeah.

Speaker 4   34:44
Curiosity or curious?

Speaker 2   34:47
Yeah. The,

Speaker 4   34:48
The one core value that is undermine core value that we never mentioned curious.

Speaker 1   35:00
Okay. I don't know what's calling everybody.

Speaker 2   35:05
With the laptop version.

Speaker 1   35:06
Yeah. Okay. Now that's great. Well actually those are really good ones. Yeah. One last anyone wants one comes to mind wants to end. And we'll try to vote for maybe one or two because we don't want to make

Speaker 3   35:20
It. So proud of our saturated.

Speaker 1   35:22
I got an advice one time. No let's have four or five he said even three but i said okay. Well I don't know creature, but we came with five

Speaker 2   35:30
Did that maybe

Speaker 3   35:31
Spies is good?

Speaker 2   35:33
Yeah,

Speaker 1   35:34
Yeah. Life is good.

Speaker 3   35:35
I think we could replace value with replacements.

Speaker 2   35:37
I think i think humid, humility could probably be swapped for something here too.

Speaker 1   35:42
Okay. And

Speaker 2   35:43
I think maybe let's remove punctual. It's probably not a good word. Okay.

Speaker 1   35:47
So

Speaker 2   35:48
There's better words right? Better better.

Speaker 1   35:51
Sure. I

Speaker 2   35:52
Like innovative, i like

Speaker 3   35:54
Innovative q. I like curiosity is well.

Speaker 1   35:58
Okay so that's good.

Speaker 2   36:00
Resilient Religions or something resourceful. Statistics

Speaker 1   36:08
Or

Speaker 2   36:08
Stubborn.

Speaker 1   36:09
Stubborn.

Speaker 2   36:18
A lot of persistent like a next level research.

Speaker 1   36:23
Okay,

Speaker 2   36:24
Instead of a cure, Confidence. We put arrogance.

Speaker 1   36:30
Yeah.

Speaker 2   36:36
Ignorance. There we

Speaker 1   36:37
Go. You want me to replace it? It was a replace.

Speaker 2   36:40
I like it. That's even that's maybe so we can cross that line up, so sure.

Speaker 1   36:49
This one here.

Speaker 2   36:51
Yeah.

Speaker 1   36:51
All right. So let's let's select then. But you're taking notes, we're going to replace value with something. And then humility looks like we should is there something, okay? Technology. Maybe. It's not the necessary, the best word but it is conveying a message to whoever is reading. Okay, well, there's something. Uh, in it i like to say I like to say that our team has this in in natural, it's nature to some of us and it is something that i'm Feeling that it is. What's making us sometimes win relationships. Maybe not. Not exactly like the maybe there is a better word but i i wonder. Right. Why did you want to ask to remove this? Because it's a good never

Speaker 2   37:36
Humility. Yeah,

Speaker 1   37:37
You said

Speaker 2   37:38
I I look at it as Um, what i think, humility and i love that, i love because i think it does represent. The main ways. But i also look at it as a head down. You know, we're not. It's almost It's almost the opposite of competent. Right. You know what i mean?

Speaker 1   37:58
Yeah

Speaker 3   37:58
And it's kind of like have a negative

Speaker 5   38:01
How about accountability, but

Speaker 2   38:03
I like the yeah.

Speaker 3   38:08
Ingenuity. It's like across between innovation.

Speaker 2   38:10
Yeah, yeah. And i actually like dependable.

Speaker 1   38:16
Let's say henry

Speaker 3   38:17
That's an ingenuity.

Speaker 5   38:18
It's

Speaker 3   38:20
A combination of being like innovative. I think creatively, advised original solutions. Okay, so

Speaker 1   38:30
I see that. Foreign product indeed and i was always wondering about. Yeah that

Speaker 2   38:36
So okay so i would say first we looked at integrity And again, take her any psych, a lot of other things but it might be that Honesty. As good as a word is. Combining say integrity with a word like dependable, almost implies. Honestly, that makes

Speaker 5   38:57
Sense. That's true.

Speaker 2   38:59
Or dependability or something on something like dependable and With. And humility was just, can we tweak it to? More competence raised or more but i really like ingenuity

Speaker 1   39:19
Because

Speaker 2   39:20
It incorporates like like Henry nailed it. I think it just

Speaker 1   39:24
Two people and how do you count for that second? Okay. So,

Speaker 2   39:32
I think it was a third here.

Speaker 1   39:33
Okay.

Speaker 5   39:38
As the best one.

Speaker 1   39:39
So what we said, we have gonna remove interest or taking this Notes and then values. Thank

Speaker 2   39:49
You. Yeah,

Speaker 1   39:50
And you said honesty is moved out and replace it with because you're saying integrity and And the

Speaker 5   39:59
Pain.

Speaker 2   39:59
Okay. A reliable dependable or reliable, or something.

Speaker 3   40:06
Very close, right. Humility you use. Modesty. Yeah, that's a that's

Speaker 2   40:12
A good tragedy. It's like limitless. Just a picture. Yeah. These. And, Well, maybe is there other ones we can strike know? Persistence. Do we like it?

Speaker 3   40:38
I like it. I think we can describe it in other ways. Yeah,

Speaker 5   40:41
I

Speaker 2   40:41
Think

Speaker 5   40:41
I don't

Speaker 2   40:42
It's Like, i think it's in there with Like dependability or reliability something?

Speaker 5   40:49
Yeah. I think reliability and a good word.

Speaker 1   40:56
Reliabilities

Speaker 5   40:57
The liability.

Speaker 1   40:58
Okay,

Speaker 2   40:59
Yeah. They're very they're very close, right? Yeah.

Speaker 5   41:02
The end of a booty and persistent gravity. More coffee.

Speaker 1   41:09
But we'll take a break at 1 30 for sure, for like, a So launches actually, pizza and donna? Cook

Speaker 5   41:17
Something possible. Oh nice.

Speaker 1   41:20
Wow.

Speaker 3   41:21
Oh asleep. You know, those cars?

Speaker 1   41:24
Yeah. Yeah, maybe watch out on that for sure. Um, Dependability.

Speaker 7   41:32
Sorry, we were talking about persistence, right?

Speaker 1   41:36
Yeah. Actually a good idea, probably, to take a straight stretching, break. Sure some

Speaker 4   41:43
Oxygen, some o2? Yeah. Just

Speaker 1   41:45
A minute or two. And well, what? Continue on this exercise?

Speaker 5   41:48
A few would be compassion compassion,

Speaker 1   41:52
Okay?

Speaker 3   41:53
Right.

Speaker 5   41:56
We do have a compassion

Speaker 1   41:58
People. We had compassion, i think.

Speaker 3   42:01
When's the last time you guys had changed the core value. Probably,

Speaker 1   42:05
I think we came with us in 2020.

Speaker 3   42:07
Yes, they've been the same since I've been

Speaker 2   42:09
Like it was a little later than that.

Speaker 1   42:11
A little learning

Speaker 3   42:12
Franklin. I remember probably two years ago i would say

Speaker 1   42:15
I'm kind of actually pull up my one north and i read you. I'll have Uh, i'll have all the ones that we even talked about. Uh, let's see here. Let's go. Open, you know. That

Speaker 2   42:54
I didn't mean to quite. Oh no, no, that's washed any momentum here.

Speaker 1   42:57
No, i thought it's a good. Uh, Idea to just take a quick stretching break for everybody.

Speaker 2   43:03
How long

Speaker 1   43:04
But maybe a minute or two? I

Speaker 5   43:06
Mean i

Speaker 2   43:08
Want to smoke.

Speaker 1   43:09
Okay. Yeah. Just

Speaker 2   43:13
Hide under the table.

Speaker 1   43:15
Yeah, just

Speaker 5   43:20
I have to go down. So however, later

Speaker 1   43:23
That's what? Okay. Maybe

Speaker 5   43:39
I'll go through the washroom.

Speaker 1   50:20
Give me. Words yourself conference is important to have us. Do that over. I

Speaker 3   51:05
Like it,

Speaker 1   51:06
So it's I'll even write it down.

Speaker 2   51:12
You should have seen my mood, gently coffee over there. Oh, he's a barista. Okay.

Speaker 3   51:21
One of the psychology is between the color of this room, i was just thinking about it to keep you

Speaker 2   51:26
Away. Yeah,

Speaker 5   51:27
All the yeah

Speaker 2   51:28
Probably anger, sprite. Great bright, green, new growth cleanliness. It's probably for a reason, right? The green should actually soothing pink in here. I'm

Speaker 1   51:40
Not sure, yeah, actually, i always wondered because it's it didn't make sense. They got a deal on it, it

Speaker 3   51:46
Definitely did he

Speaker 2   51:47
Following your energy or something? Yeah, i think you're right. That's, i never thought about this way, but did you guys see what i did with the, the smart park lenders over there? We don't know. So you can see from the little when you come in doesn't say smart park anymore.

Speaker 1   52:07
So actually, while we were Just before we went on a break. It's over reminded me that the session we had last time. What similar exercise was back in 2022.

Speaker 2   52:19
April 11 2022. I know you and i have gone through these before because these decks were handy. When you were meeting in a customer service, we

Speaker 1   52:30
Probably wasn't for the CRM proposal, perhaps we were having,

Speaker 2   52:33
You had three things and expanded a bit

Speaker 1   52:36
That

Speaker 3   52:37
Was just before my time just

Speaker 1   52:39
A little bit before your time henry and You actually had a good. Some of the ones that we talked about, actually, when we had the session, just me and Trevor and a blah. Where integrating honest, you talk about that. We talk about compassion we we have the understand the ability to understand specific people It happens when expecting people to be either caregivers or recipients at different times. We talk about considerate, we talk about visionary. We talked about prompt humble. And,

Speaker 2   53:12
Let's see, we talked about a few others as well. I remember i was talking about Confidentiality and trying to get out across. We kind of said, well, integrity

Speaker 5   53:21
Integrity. Yeah,

Speaker 2   53:22
Of sums add up, right?

Speaker 1   53:24
Confidentiality. Okay, well,

Speaker 2   53:30
You know, just capture those and then maybe that's a yeah.

Speaker 1   53:35
Okay, well sleep on them i guess and then see what What can come out of it? Yeah, we'll move forward in your team. And just because you didn't hear it at 130, we're going to take our lunch break, okay? So it happened hour food should be here a

Speaker 2   53:54
Little bit after that, but

Speaker 1   53:55
Sound great. Yeah. All right, i could. Go through them here. So we get the most calories. Okay, so Uh, team core values document that we're gonna digest. What you guys talk about here. Thank you very much. It is valuable feedback. I will see what these. How we can fit the? The discussion here into what we had. Before. Uh, this is here, you know, it's always helpful when especially, we're talking when you Investor or somebody who wants to look at the company or understand? Who is here. We want to tell them. It's not just me. It's not just a dollar. Who saw who they see? This is There's a fair amount of people who built and who got us to where we are as a team as a company and and this is just a really again another symbolic slide here to tell you who is around. There may be other people who i may have best, but this is just who we interact with. On a periodic basis, whether it is already today or monthly, or maybe annually, Uh, this is what you see here. So you see the core team, the the full-time staff, who make sure the this company is really standing on on solid foundation. You've got myself and abdullah as well. Who we constantly Are here to nurture develop and keep things moving. You've got. A number of great advisors in the company. Uh, you may have seen some and some you may not have seen. You have got some other people who help us in. On occasional basis, whether it is like web design, or Marketing and, and so on. And forgive me, john at a slight may be slightly outdated so i apologize. Your name is not there. Uh, but i do have to apply. If you could just make another as well, your name. God, the accountant. The lawyer. Of the company. And yeah, you've got a co-founder who started with the company as well in case if you guys don't know Muhammad al noury. He is a German who studied here at the university of Manitoba. That's how i met him. I he did his underground mechanical engineering and master and mechanical worked for a great company called slb and they transferred him from Canada, he was to work in the northwestern territories. Arabia his work, where he's working with the same company. Now really doing great, but he's not as in touch with the company unfortunately. For the last five years or so. As a matter of fact, Hey, one of the people who is looking to really exit completely, just because of the the geographical and the time zone different. So We've got Madison who invested in the company in 2016. Uh, i really not another great gentleman who works at cisco. He manages He's the original manager for Cisco in the Middle East. 13, 14 plus years of experience with Cisco. Everybody knows what cisco is. So yeah. And yeah.

Speaker 2   57:00
Mother and additional one.

Speaker 8   57:02
But, You know,

Speaker 2   57:05
Another another, another partner.

Speaker 1   57:10
Um, so it's Yeah, yeah. Muhammad and Annabella. Are you refrained? Muhammad ullah.

Speaker 2   57:18
No, i thought there was a like, a third, no, i thought there was a third. There were never imagined.

Speaker 1   57:22
That's the team

Speaker 4   57:24
Myself. And the well, let me guess so,

Speaker 2   57:27
My mood is we're operations.

Speaker 1   57:31
Uh so just a couple slides.to who are the people you guys know us. So i don't need to Say much. In here. How much works SLB largest organ gas company in the world pretty much He played a positive role at the beginning. He has a strong finance background, he really helped the company at the beginning, in financial management and also he's been on the ground multiple times. Um, God, Trevor and henry or the staff in the company. Really keep the lights on and Make sure customers are happy. Company financials. All right, let's get to some density here team. So i again this the goal of this meeting is to collaborate. Create a level of transparency and also get your feedback and input. And you cannot see the full picture. If you don't see the financials, you cannot understand what you're working with. If you don't see this. There weren't occasions when there weren't there were never an occasion where, you know, i thought i should share or let you guys know. About it, there were never questions, but i, i thought, you know, it will help us well, formulating, a good good idea. Obvious, it's mandatory when we talk about investors and owners. It's mandatory for us. It's what they want to see. Uh, so The company financials over the the last years has been steadily. Increase in terms of revenue. So we have been our sales have an increasing Uh and you know, our our expenses, i've been also increasing as a result. And so this here, this slide gives you a really good idea of of the of the company's growth, right? So you've got in 2020 2021. Under 300k in revenue. And 2021 20 22 a little over 500 and then 2022-20 23. Uh, a little bit less than 700. And then now, last year has dropped a little bit. Um, You guys are inside the company so you probably could quickly explain the drop in the last year. You know, based on on a few elements that you are well aware of But that gives you a really good idea. Now, this doesn't tell you the full picture because this is only your revenue. It's not telling you expenses, nothing in your profit, not telling you much this next slide is where the real dense data. Is is located. And, And you know what? Uh, Don't. Uh, basically don't make the slide scare you. Okay? So and don't misunderstand for it. It's there, it's the facts. You know, it's so Let's talk about an event here. Revenue, we talked about it, show you in the previous slide where we were at. And our tall cogs. If you're not remember the term clouds, anybody knows what causes i'm sure rod. Probably knows but maybe others just curious cost of something cost of something indeed? Yeah Trevory You, you're surprised me with your financials because the other they were telling me grass profit and net profit. Like, oh, Okay. You know, that's right. No,

Speaker 2   1:00:55
I don't. I i'm gonna guess. Good concern services.

Speaker 1   1:00:59
Uh so uh Exactly cost of goods and service. Sorry, no, cost of good soul.

Speaker 2   1:01:04
Okay,

Speaker 1   1:01:05
Okay, so cards stands for cost of goods sold. Uh, it's just a very common term that you would see in a financial statements. If you are looking at a company to invest in or even buy stocks, if you look at their statements you'll quickly see the total cogs. So that's how much they bought. Uh, stinks that they sell sold so, so we bought this much in in 2021 2022. Last year, we bought 277 thousand dollars. Goods that we sold and those goods and that we sold our cover, that not probably in this in these slides here but think about them. What are they team?

Speaker 3   1:01:43
What do you think like hardware hardware

Speaker 9   1:01:46
Software life?

Speaker 1   1:01:47
That's how much we bought. Um, sorry question. Um,

Speaker 3   1:01:52
So, Cost of goods sold. So, um, is that just the total price of the, you know, the object or whatever it is, right? That doesn't include, that's not like profit. That's just the problem. Okay,

Speaker 1   1:02:04
That's how much it costed us.

Speaker 2   1:02:06
Yeah, so

Speaker 1   1:02:06
That's why you see the next element. Here goes gross profit. So, right. Right away. When you do revenue, minus total cost. That gives you the gross profit now. Gross profit does not account for. The operation cost and any general? A company. When you read, okay, tutorial, we made gross profit 192k amazing. This is a very popular company. The thing that's not covered here is the operational cost. And that's what the next element. Tells you that all cost of operations which is, you know, rent office salaries. Insurance advisory you name it? Lawyers accountants. Software that the company subscribing to to maintain itself. Uh, all of that is covered in the operating expenses. This here, really tells you It's amazing. Good job, guys. You lower your operating expense last year. You're starting to show a little bit of a Better net profit than what you used to. So that's what you could read from this, you know, a little bit of positivity here. We've done a good job. I guess last year trying to cut down on unnecessary costs, you have seen some of that. And we want to continue on doing the same. We want to continue on driving net profit to be further ahead by not only cutting down on cost and optimizing what we have but also increasing sales, right? We want to continue to increase revenue. Bring new customers, we want to continue to work on that bottom line, that's what sometimes customers or companies refer to as the bottom line. So that's that's a huge vector for our company from a financial perspective. Not even because we like to see profit but also we want to It's extremely important. We will we can collapse as a company if we continue to to be on the negative side. So So, we want Uh, if i could If i could make an ask based on this, slide from everyone who's in one of the company esteem help us. Reduced. Expenses. And dry revenue. Drive revenue by sales and then there's so many different ways and reduce expenses and i'm not talking about, you know, a dollar or two. Of course, these are important door and to the add-off. But i'm talking about significant expenses. Um, You always want to look at. Saving a hundred dollar and how much it would cost you to save that hundred dollar versus Saving ten thousand dollars and how much that will cost. You one is one example would be is, you know, the maybe within like that example so much. But the slash, for example. Okay, let's cut down, let's remove slack, so it's extra expenses. How much flag is costing us, maybe 89 bucks or 100 bucks a month. How much would it take as an effort to move away from slot, right? And a fair amount of maybe getting used to do, we care about the data, do we not the value versus how much right as you're saving? So so to me, i wouldn't prioritize. Canceling slack. Because, Again, i'm paying just 100 bucks, it's retaining a fair amount of value. Uh, but just I meant to mention a small example. Yeah, that's a good example of Of how, you know, it's an expense but From the big scheme of things is that where we should put our time on or i put it on maybe driving more sales, be more strategic to be more more 100% with limited resources. This next slide here gives you the health roughly of the last year. So, you know, it's it's up to date. And tell december. Uh, 10th or so. So the orange represents expenses, the green represents income And, Uh you could see here, it's just really all over the places, you know, some months are high, some months are a little bit lower. Um, It just, you could. I guess what you could understand from this slide here is that there is always a minimum, right? Every month, the green here, tells you roughly, it's between about 25k or so, and that's really the recurring income that we're making from customers, right? So that's it's, it's in every month, it's not really dropping lower than 25k. And actually the next slide, we'll tell you a little more about what is the monthly income that the company is making from customers.

Speaker 4   1:06:34
So,

Speaker 1   1:06:34
Our customers on recurring, Uh, monthly spending. With us. We have some who are on a month to month, we have some on an yearly basis and we have some who are every six months, Um, and also have a breakdown because we were asked to do that. We have a breakdown, you know? Of the top nine customers, for example, on how much

Speaker 3   1:07:04
It

Speaker 1   1:07:05
Is because the previous slide here. It's not telling you the full picture, right? It's telling you how much you're making, but how much is that a service? And how much is that? How much of that is the service and how much of that is? Is resellable, resellable versus non-resalable. Non-resolve, and resellable is tax and ions, right? Like, like licenses, like

Speaker 4   1:07:27
We, for example, licenses, we take them from microsoft and we just With the skin off it. Yeah, we and we add like a little bit of maybe 10 percent, 10 15 percent. Now we just resell it

Speaker 10   1:07:39
Just really no value. We're just simply

Speaker 4   1:07:42
Taking the license at reselling, so

Speaker 1   1:07:43
It's telling you here, if you are interested, you know, we just put a custom one, two, three, just to hide there. 90 years, we want to share with the potential wires. But that tells you a briefly. Um, What's the division? So, who are the example of the very first customer? You guys know it's FGC. Right now, you can see that they're paying 5500 in service, they're paying what we can. I ask that's Azure and they are paying 5k in SAS so that's like their licenses of various different things. All right, so that's that. Now we talk about plants for the future, here is a good a good slide but before i maybe jump into that, we covered a lot of information there in the numbers and Uh, and i'm also Got to watch for the time here. What is any questions? Any questions do you always wanted to expand on that? A little more less. Um,

Speaker 2   1:08:39
That's a great slide actually. Yeah, i

Speaker 9   1:08:42
Mean,

Speaker 3   1:08:42
I guess just the net profit.

Speaker 5   1:08:43
Yeah. And that's, that's scaring me. The net profits, like,

Speaker 1   1:08:46
I do scared. Absolutely. You know, companies do have like, early stages and, you know, i should say, the year prior to this 20 21, 22, we were probably at Uh maybe like a zero or so, like so we dropped really in the last two years like we made a Huge commitments on different things based on Certain customers decisions and whatnot. And we weren't able. Yeah, it kind of didn't go that way we expected and that's sort of why you see some of that. Um, But what companies in some stages they do go negative profit. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're out of business, it means they're just making more investments. And and you know, hopefully which were very faithful that it will certainly come back to to Uh, i'm optimistic that We still have got two more months. Basically, our fiscal year runs from march to February. That's why you see in the marsh defend. So, few more months i'm very optimistic that will be If not. Positive at least it will be zero and and then hopefully the year after Will be quite a quit. A bit of a different story. What do

Speaker 3   1:10:02
You think is like the leading contributing factor that we you know, at least we can risk for at 11 now and i was 64 before. Is that just, you know, we're running tighter as a company. Like, what what have we stopped doing to?

Speaker 5   1:10:15
You have to let go appliance,

Speaker 1   1:10:17
Yeah. The yeah, the, the very good question. Like, i think you guys because you're in the company, probably can quickly even answer this yourself, but to elaborate, Um, i mean we we as a team sort of reduce our size a little bit, right? So instead of having look at that line above,

Speaker 2   1:10:38
Yeah, going from from 330 to 203. Okay. That's a, that's a massive pencil sharp knee exercise that my mood's gone through in the last year. Of how do we streamline and whether that's again product simplification. So we're not paying licenses on a bunch of things. Um, you know, amalgamation of vocation of offices things like that being a little more cognizant about,

Speaker 1   1:11:03
You

Speaker 2   1:11:03
Know, consultants and when they're needed and things like that. Those those all make a difference right now. Compared to save my

Speaker 1   1:11:09
Life. Absolutely well said, right? Thank you. And

Speaker 2   1:11:12
Of course, You know, i think if we sum up the marsh or the the 20, the the year 2022, Hey, that was, you know. We had the The Stanley Cup winners, the fgc looking like there were other wave going somewhere, right? And you know hey gave us a sphere of You can't grow fast enough, right? So wanted to be ahead of that. Roll this growth and yet we know what happened there and consequently had to react. And i think looking at that, you know, last column going down there, That's a pretty good reaction.

Speaker 1   1:11:48
Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2   1:11:50
And let's, let's remember that companies like Starling. I think it's just now starting to turn profit this year after being out for how many years. Um serious exam, rain bird major

Speaker 3   1:12:04
Losses. Until i don't think they're making fun.

Speaker 2   1:12:06
I think it's starting this year finally.

Speaker 1   1:12:08
But yeah, they don't like, i never knew that. Yeah,

Speaker 2   1:12:11
Monstrous company and yet software company.

Speaker 3   1:12:15
They're not, they're not providing cabs, they're not like a sign of why is, uh, is it just because they're trying to kick taxis out and eventually they will. And then that's when they'll really start making products because they're total loss is like, out of 500 thousand few million every single year. Like, yeah, it's a total amount of money that they've lost is insane. I

Speaker 2   1:12:31
Think that they are probably heavily reliant on. Lawyers working through permits. Litigation issues within every jurisdiction. They're in and try to understand every market. Look how long they fought here to get in.

Speaker 1   1:12:47
Yeah.

Speaker 2   1:12:48
And somewhere there was probably a team of lawyers working on that, right? Like oh the bury, you know,

Speaker 1   1:12:54
The cost is the initial investment. It's

Speaker 2   1:12:55
Like very

Speaker 1   1:12:56
Steep investment but

Speaker 2   1:12:58
If you look at those models air Airbnb, You know, uber lift, whatever they are software companies. All they're doing is saying you're put an app. On your phone, goes through some things to become a driver. But they're not providing services, right? Like they're not they're not buying cabs some places. They might have pilot highly versions but for the most part they're soft workout

Speaker 1   1:13:23
Another one too. I don't know if they start to make money but i always Like at least as of last year,

Speaker 4   1:13:29
Especially after Elon acquisition,

Speaker 2   1:13:31
I don't think he makes money for a while, but I don't think he cares either

Speaker 4   1:13:38
Again.

Speaker 2   1:13:38
Starling

Speaker 1   1:13:39
The

Speaker 2   1:13:40
Spacex rates.

Speaker 8   1:13:41
Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1   1:13:43
So yeah, lots lots to certainly understand from this and it is Uh yeah. Some it's it's the numbers theme. You know, numbers don't apply it's sometimes they have hard facts and It's

Speaker 4   1:13:56
They don't lie. But they don't also convey the intangible.

Speaker 1   1:14:00
Right,

Speaker 4   1:14:01
Like

Speaker 2   1:14:01
This

Speaker 4   1:14:03
Is talking about the tangible but what this this i guess this this slide is and this slide is not convening as the brand, right? We're building a really good brand. Ask anybody, who will look at a website. Like whoa. This is like

Speaker 3   1:14:18
Enterprise level.

Speaker 2   1:14:19
Yeah, it's a really good website.

Speaker 4   1:14:21
Yeah, we've gone through so many iterations on that website. Like the services Fly down menu, the products like that. It's just, you know, so it's silly lots. Still need a lot more work

Speaker 1   1:14:33
Here.

Speaker 5   1:14:34
Yeah.

Speaker 2   1:14:35
And if we look at this like this, this number here, And just go back. Pretty fgc. Look at that. It's not that hard but what's happened in the last two years, too like Everybody's a little more cautious with their money and a little more diligent all of it. So everything is cost more but also people are tightening their belts too. So Now, what is this number look like? If that is the income. Suddenly it's flipped over you go. Oh wow. We Oh, there's a different way that there's a plus net, you know. At least next to it, right? So It doesn't take that much because there's a lot of variables, but i mean, got to be proud of this like this number here. Remember that took a lot of work buddy?

Speaker 1   1:15:19
Right? That's yeah.

Speaker 2   1:15:21
It there's a wood shavings all over here. All over your office. Some tough decisions. It's very tough decisions. For sure. Yeah,

Speaker 1   1:15:31
There's some tough decisions, easy to You know, like, for example, a lot of having to find another opportunity, right? It's not easy to hem to make that decision. Thankfully, it worked out where he had to it's not easy. We had to, you know leave our good office in downtown. It is actually we spend really good time in it. Uh, they're now but you know, you have to sometimes Decide. Okay, when do you have to your emotionals things? But we have to sometimes. Just look at look at what look at the numbers a bit and

Speaker 2   1:16:02
And there's good bones here.

Speaker 1   1:16:04
Like you say, like,

Speaker 2   1:16:05
You know, what is Processes web. Website enterprise look, you

Speaker 10   1:16:11
Know, the tools, the vendor

Speaker 2   1:16:14
Relationships. You have, there's a lot of good boats.

Speaker 1   1:16:15
I've also be a grateful for everybody's support and openness to, for police changes because every change that we made, thankfully, everyone here was just supportive and And even like really just saying, yeah, that's the right thing to do, like, let's move on. And so that's really helpful, you know, like i want to say i'm just grateful and we're really happy that that thankfully else changes have Brought some positive results and brought us even to a lot better positions. Uh, like i don't remember when one incident where we let go of something or we decided to watch out for it. And it causes pain like thankfully. So that just accountability is very important. I think it is what? Yeah, i'm We're grateful to be where we are here and then we'll continue to be to drive to drive. Forward stronger, and yeah. So, Uh, plans for the future. As a company we want to apply to the sbvcdc. It's

Speaker 8   1:17:22
A say that 10 times.

Speaker 1   1:17:23
Yeah, i say that 10 times. Yeah.

Speaker 4   1:17:25
It's,

Speaker 1   1:17:25
It's So, that's from a business perspective again team. You know, there are, i think i would like to also chat with you about the technology side of things and where we like things to be Uh, but from a very high level, we want to apply to that. So, what's that? Actually it's, it's a program from the government manager but to incentify Local people to invest in local businesses. It gives it's a tax credit program, it gives 45 percent. To the individuals. In tax credit in Manitoba tax credit because of their investment. So if they invest 50k they get 45% back of that. Uh, And, Uh, it's really like it's a it's an amazing program. I think. So we're going to apply to it as a company to allow people. In the province, who wants to invest. Uh in us we want to focus on speed up more. It's just a something we established and the lade of last year and we're going to grow more on it. There's money on the table. There are businesses want to invest. We've gotten a few customers, reaching out to us from cdap. So i think there's a potential there. We want to build scalable sales process. This is a very important one. We want to build a scalable sales process, not a sales team, not just selling, we're going to build a scalable sales process. How can we make it? You know, we have sold in the past. We've sold, we're secured. Many customers, not not new to us, but how do we make it skill? How do we make a continuous? Always been new customers. Uh, me and john, we chatted briefly with you and me constantly talk about How do we build this, you know? Yeah, the sales process as a matter of fact, next week, i will be connecting with a Coach in New Zealand. At sales coach. Who she worked for a company who sold a lot for microsoft services. And i'm hoping to get a good. A good input from her but you have got some ideas. You know, i think just me being all over the places. And running a small tie chip here, it's not where what? What? Custom ideas? I think we need to collaboration from everybody on this. It is a problem. The team that the company without a good strong sales, Uh, that bottom line will not be raised. So it is a problem. Myself abdullah and i want all of everybody to think about as a problem. How can we put our brain and our energy? And then so we can make it bigger, we can solve this problem. We've got a tech brain. We've got a problem solving brain and deal with this as a problem. How can we apply some engineering? We can chat more about it. But this is one of the things. We want to establish my document that counting and financial process right now. There are different pieces of accounting. Some external team are involved. Some internal team are involved. It's not well documented. We want to work on that. To the last scale. Um, we went optimize the customer journey process from sales to service delivery, right now there's a lot of manual processing tests so you know, we get them to sign on a docuSign form when they join when they become a customer. And then we have to manually enter information in fresh service, in Johor, customer caller presented, a lot of manual pieces. We're going to optimize this journey a little bit. And, We want to expand to new services. Of course, you guys know what the large language models. Things like charging and many others. Are out there and they are very aggressive in the market and a lot of businesses want to get them but they don't know how they don't know how to get these services in a secure seamless way into their practices. We want to participate in that there's a lot of potential there. It's it's a, it's a very, very very, very early stages right now and And we see open hours doing a lot of work. As a matter of fact, just three days ago they introduced A charging 14s. So the interest rate of people enterprise for a little large companies but now they're trying to be and a teams which will allow teams each to have their own charity, and they can collaborate as a team on these There's a lot of potential there just literally came three days ago. Um excited to have bring it to our team as well when they get started.

Speaker 2   1:21:38
So i think that goes back to your your solution slides,

Speaker 1   1:21:41
We

Speaker 2   1:21:42
Discussed automation. Like integration. Automation right. Like how do you integrate? Lms in that

Speaker 1   1:21:52
Right in their business. So

Speaker 2   1:21:53
That we have a 30 years life is kind of a dual purpose automation and integration.

Speaker 3   1:21:58
Love it. Look great. My question there is so if we leverage tools like Microsoft co-pilot or whatever it may be, how are we making money? If we're you know reselling a license and that sort of thing? How can you leverage that for

Speaker 2   1:22:12
You're hooking up your plumbing to it, right? You're the You're the plumber either because they're going, hey, there's a tool here.

Speaker 3   1:22:18
Yeah, i guess where the kind of one of the leading companies that Puts it on the forefront and showcases it'll be more attractive like our company to potential customers.

Speaker 4   1:22:27
I think that's a good question Henry we thought actually yeah we actually discussed that.

Speaker 1   1:22:31
And

Speaker 4   1:22:31
So, the real value would be And training. Training. Those companies, those enterprise on how to use it, that's a real value, okay? Because like again reselling, licenses that anybody can do that.

Speaker 3   1:22:45
You need to. I was like

Speaker 4   1:22:46
Oh here's the license. Okay, thank you.

Speaker 2   1:22:48
But yeah. And you train train, can you implement it and get that

Speaker 3   1:22:51
Like workshops and

Speaker 1   1:22:53
Integrated to it, right? And great. Yeah, it comes to Charge ability enterprise for example and try to be teams. How do you connect this with the company data sources? So the company have their own share point, they have their own databases. How do they connect this? The plus rod mentioned, the plumbing? From this engine. So it knows how to bring meaningful answers based on their own data. Yeah, so there's a lot of So and these licenses are not cheap.

Speaker 4   1:23:22
And so when like for example in 365, you can look at the user's reports. They're like hmm this company is paying thousands of dollars a month for co-pilot but like only quarter of the companies using it. So

Speaker 3   1:23:34
Yeah, we're like a rollout plan or something like that. I think that's a great idea.

Speaker 1   1:23:38
I'll be there. It should be

Speaker 3   1:23:39
Into one of the first priorities. It's first training. Our staff on how to use it, right? Yeah. Certifications are kind of Interesting. That's it. Yeah

Speaker 4   1:23:51
Certified, i'm sorry. Yeah.

Speaker 3   1:23:57
It will need to do that, like the advertise it, and then we'll need to find a puppy, that's large enough to actually be able to use it. And then plan, those workshops to

Speaker 1   1:24:06
China employees, So love it. Go by certification about it. Look into

Speaker 4   1:24:13
Sort of. Yeah we're copa certified hats, that's it. We all learn together.

Speaker 3   1:24:19
Share information with each other. I think eventually we're all going to have to know how to use these. Controls right?

Speaker 2   1:24:24
Yeah.

Speaker 3   1:24:24
Not one of us is going to be over, specialize it and then offers You know that it's going to be a big company that's going to have to leverage them so we're all going to have to play a hand and learning that.

Speaker 1   1:24:34
That's right.

Speaker 2   1:24:35
Yeah, and then, somewhere in there, developing use cases, right? The show a company. Hey, you know what, we worked with this other company that said we want, You know, some sort of Automation. You know, whether it was a customer phone call in. Uh, there's some sort of chat function there that is answered the questions and Uh, able to get them an answer or a process done. So yeah. How do they get done? And now you can showcase that to the next customer.

Speaker 1   1:25:04
I mean, you have the conversation, i'll be right back. She's going to bring the pizza. I

Speaker 3   1:25:08
Think like up houses, probably one of the best kind of customers to Use as an example that would leverage that, i mean not the different companies that they kind of Our in communications with just like leveraging, you know, different Contact forms or whatever. They may use and they're very innovative and making videos and they need that creativity, kind of long.

Speaker 2   1:25:29
So see that exercise kick. Yeah, and you got to think that there's a A company out there. There's a CEO here in the buzzwords of You know chatty video AI? I got to use this. Yeah. But doesn't have that next, you know? Great. I can go. Leverage the tool. But who's going to hook it up for me, right? Who's going to get that going? And that's where there's going to be probably a lot of work. Um

Speaker 3   1:25:54
And

Speaker 2   1:25:55
And there's frankly there's going to be a lot of companies that well, they aren't even there yet. They're not using email addresses ready

Speaker 3   1:26:01
For them.

Speaker 2   1:26:01
But somewhere you can get in on that journey and say great to get you there, we got to take three steps to get there, right?

Speaker 3   1:26:08
So again who's telling you that right?

Speaker 2   1:26:11
And they might not have a night, a lot of companies don't have an IT person in a little or a department,

Speaker 3   1:26:16
Right?

Speaker 4   1:26:17
There's right to that point, there's always the hype and then reality,

Speaker 3   1:26:20
Oh,

Speaker 4   1:26:21
Cyber security bleeding edge. Reality upgrading from server 2012, 2016, right? We're still doing that 16. Yeah.

Speaker 1   1:26:32
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Co-pilot certification. Yeah, i wonder there's Is something for that now eh well you know that ms900

Speaker 3   1:26:47
I went through that last plaid thing and like this is so outdated and then they just They actually talked about co-pilot a lot, it wasn't on my exam, but it could tell that they're just pushing that out of

Speaker 1   1:26:57
Yeah.

Speaker 4   1:27:00
I think, i think if i think with microsoft, Search, if if If the product is still in preview mode? Yeah. They don't, or if certain features in preview mode, they that You're like, you don't encode these in in the exams. Until that product becomes generally available, right?

Speaker 2   1:27:18
And remember right now, they bought a They've made a whole bunch of stickers and say, co-pilot and they're slapping it on everything, right? It's all yeah, bing, it's

Speaker 3   1:27:26
All. Yeah,

Speaker 2   1:27:26
Yes. We've got to also, you know, we read more this and then over the other side of the fence, right? There's Google card whatever. Yeah gemini and they're going with their own stack, right? And then, you know, everybody's got an AI, it's trying to pick one and i think the cool pilot will be good because well, it's going to be baked into office. It's always yeah.

Speaker 3   1:27:48
Even what just happened with church bt recently, how they their chair stepped down and all these. So basically microsoft went out their hand and then a higher, like, i don't know, 100 or something like that. Really. Like, Intuitive. And like, Different developers directly from chat GPT over to microsoft. So there's tons of, you know, brands that they've hired direct from them and i was like a two months ago

Speaker 2   1:28:10
So i think yeah and we certification that develop once i think microsoft starts to refine what is the co-pilot service right now they're doing this. Yeah it is yeah. Yeah, but they're exciting. The other thing is It's funny because i never would have thought about it. But

Speaker 1   1:28:38
And maybe this is for medium size businesses, maybe a little Wow, SharePoint. And what you can do with it, it's Working right now that really high level SharePoint resource. I mean he's building basically apps within that. Yeah. Yeah. And and a workflows and yeah. You know, it's not. It's pretty cool, right?

So yeah, is it behind the scenes? You got to think that most companies, Are saying, how can i get by? You know, with less employees. They're not trying to say that they're just saying, okay, i'm at a hard time retaining stuff and getting stuff. And doing more with less, right?

Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, yeah, it's, it's not something maybe they're trying to do lesson of position of just trying to. Hey, i gotta survive. And i i have three people here on this trying company, right? So where can i get games?

And it's going to be interesting to see what. What is a co-pilot means. Baked into the office. The office stack and when's it If you see some of the things that spits over here, Yeah, it's nice to have, though. Especially on marketing and sales creative jobs, right? Yeah, anybody Yeah, which is right here because i didn't like, i didn't think it would take over a creative jobs.

I would be like, i thought pretty motivated. Oh, yeah. But so, i want one of the interesting use cases. This actually first hand, right? Like last week, i was, uh, Uh, Setting up into and for one of the organizations work with nova And i needed a like a wide screen background image with strong Canadian identity that reflects the, the industry that they're working at they're in the railway industry.

I just went to chat you again and say create me a A background image with those. With those sort of requirements. And it gave me something like out of the board is just wow with the Tim Hortons. And i mean, Yeah. Moose no Burger King please so. The newer version does visuals.

It does. So, that GPD. Yeah, it's, that's why they call it multimodal because it can get coding, can does it can do images, if new text, of course, it just analytics, right? Like, it can analyze things. It just, it's, it's so, It's so versatile. What what it? What it does?

You just have to think that it's a tool. In your belt that helps you, your productive is. Let's face it. Tragedy. And he can write a lot of code but you still have to be a coder exactly to go through it and say this is real or not, right.

Because they're going to be some mistakes in there, that's a lot. A lot actually sometimes. So one thing about chatapy and these elements, they they're very good at going from 10 to 100 but they can go from zero to one. If you can't create something out of nothing. And that's where you still.

You still need you. You're the brain, right? Yeah, but if you, if you feed it, something, if you feed it like step, then it can. It can Do multiply that from 10 to 100 and go pretty fast at that. It's pretty impressive. Like for chat GBT like there's other ones, we're talking about image, creations that image, really train the context and you have to like, almost teach it.

You know, what is related to what? What challgebt is like super advanced? Like understands contexts that'll get better and in a natural way, right? In a natural language. Yeah. Yeah. So talking about lm actually, i was, uh, To the next point here, trying to establish Ownership with the government of canada for being on their pro services supplier list.

Preferred. What spoilers? Which is something very promising. And the gentlemen that i was speaking with his name is Chris, he's actually resizing Calgary. And, Uh, he told me. Hey well Don't want llam. We're at the government here, trying to put an rfp out. For to get the trades, the right trades to help us build a bridge.

With llam helped me know which trades. I need to build a bridge. And right away. He said he is not sure, he's not sure if that exists, if LM can help him, And on the phone while i was with him i don't remember a second. I pulled up the phone and told the strategy, how i was working with personal government, they are interested to know which trade will help them, build a bridge.

And it just started to talk about all the different trades, the the inspection, the safety, all the hip it blues, his mind he Hey, what's up? Wow. Wow. Like it's just it's just impressive. So that's That's where we like to be. We want to, there's certainly more to add Um, I guess.

You know, the food is best when it's hot so i don't want to take you guys away from that for longer but anything you want to comment on anything. You want to perhaps add anything, you like to see in the future in our company. That comes to mind.

I think. Your number four there. Document accounting and financial processes. Or just having some it's not even documenting, it's almost having some Some repeatable processes there, right? Like every whatever, every Wednesday, no matter what is when you know review invoices or something. Yeah yeah consistent. Yeah those don't get you know too backlogged or two and then and then you guys can step in either way or whatever producer people process in that.

Yeah. Create systems. Not goals, right? I like that create systems not goals. And create a system. So we've got us right, more systematically. Yeah, that's a very good comment, right? Thank you. Anything else? So it's not just documenting technical processes, it's also documenting the non-technical. What, what it takes to actually run the business and much like, strategy, pt somebody's going to be the driver there.

Yeah, you're telling an account or or a lawyer and you don't understand those things. That's really tough, right? Oh yeah. You want you want to say, i need this done because i don't have time, right? Yeah. But you're still the domain. I don't understand right. I don't have time.

Excellent point drawing. Okay. We have our accounting. Team over like, you know, It's it's brutal. Just yeah, maybe i'll share some of that with you when we grab our pieces, your button. It's yeah. So this next slide, you'll tell you I guess i don't so much any comment, any other points.

You guys want to add to here? No, at all. Okay, feel something. I think those are great for kind of coverage of growth in the company. Yeah. One thing about her email a couple like a month ago. Was benefits or a small company, right? And it's not the perceivable feature, but it's, i mean, it's, it's a good thing to, to think about, right?

I'm not sure, you know, how much that cost to bring on and it's totally okay, right, you know, looking into that this year but And my sister hike broke a tooth and she needs a root canal and a crown and it's like, 3200. Is that benefits? Oh yeah. So just things like that.

Just make you like oh it made me kind of work, you know. But percentage is really about taking, it's a good point about taking the steps to understand. What do you need as an organization first right? Not about the cost, but what do we need right in this game?

It's like on sales and process because if i'm the only one working on this on sales team, then Yeah. It's nearly impossible to get. Right. That's right. Because i can do the planning but i'm not good in like rod here, a very articulate to talk to people but You know, i need to know.

That's what i feel unstable on the sales process that we have in the company. Yeah, it's doable but it's kind, it's gonna be taking time. It's going to be time. And the value that i add There's nothing because i can't get. I'll say this, it was a common thing.

I went to IT nation. Last year that across the board msp said, Had a lot of Time. Can get. You know, they wrote it pretty quickly on trying to land sales. Like and you know this how many calls have you been answered that discussion? Go through the quote, go through the all this exercise to get a Yeah.

Thanks for that but never even a responsive and what is that? That means it will actually land them as a customer. You really like those when they can pay, we need something done right now and they're, they're not going on your door right next door here. The great engine.

Okay, great, they have money, that's, that's the best kind, right? You didn't have to hunt for it. Yeah. That's how do you develop that? I think it's a struggle everywhere. Is there a tool? Like i'm thinking, okay, whatever a small business used for accounting quickbooks. Is there a similar thing for that helps, you know, automation on state on marketing on emails, chats actually That's what companies are doing.

Now, like every Empty hour every day thing, send emails for them. Yes, i'm emails. Okay. But i know in canada, it's not allowed but there's see don't be in received. So there is some of it is allowed to somewhere is not and you have to really know sometimes knowing just oh it's not allowed.

That will scare you. And will not get you into the process, but there is a process. Uh, there we do need to That ties back to the scalable sales process. We absolutely need to establish that process and and it starts with a cold calling and the code coin is not Uh, we thought it will be easier but obviously it's not an easy thing.

And we do need to create a process around cold calling. And, And cocoaing may not mean may need to be broken into like a few stages. So it's gets a little simpler where stage one would be just calling everybody that you can think about every business that exist, And just checking on them.

How are they doing? Any pains any challenges? Maybe tell them something. Cool share with them. Something very insightful like tech and be weak and february. Right? That's a great. Uh, An event that connects people and technology. Tell them about it. Did you know about it? Join us, join us.

Anything you can help you with as a company and try to get with a goal of securing a meaning. With them and myself, right to just expand more into their problems and if not, that's no problem that or goes not to sell you or go solution to see. Where we got connect, we got, you know, the word that says and known.

People don't buy for me because they forgot about you or they don't know that you exist. Uh so we're going to manually. We're going to collaborate. We're going to even bring this to the team as well. Because team honestly, we do need everybody's help on that area. If we can do it once a week.

Or. Uh, or yeah. So that is a big, big problem for the team for the company right now. I just feel bad. We want to. No, no, don't, it's not. It's a big task. Yeah, i think it's simple, though. Because if the what you explained, we know that that's all.

There's a lot of work there, right? But maybe it's as simple as we simply. Need a bigger mailing list who you're sending out your messages to And is that you see a lot of companies saying, hey, we're going to give you this whatever ebook white paper pre estimate in an effort to at least get them filling out a form.

So now you can mail them That's that's a good idea actually, you can just get killed them. You didn't even have to scour, the earth you never have now, now once they're on your mailing list, You, it's not as bad. So, how do you just make your mailing list bigger?

With some sort of. Some sort of giving, right? And whether you've seen those, right, here's your uh Here's your checklist for cyber security. Yeah best practices boom. Sign up here. We'll send it to you. But how do you get those people to come to your page to sign up?

On linkedin. It could be on your page. You know as soon as they go there hey would you like to pre-book? It could be. You know, generally goes there's some sort of little promo, there's a little thing in the corner of this. This whatever when i say texas they or your other other ones technique, boom, click here for uh, you know, even if we developed some soil like and put information about your, you know, ex-business, here's the number of employees.

Here's what we use. Here's, we're having issues with. If we leverage something like that, they can automate kind of something that. Oh, here's where. You're in business needs help describe to our mailing list. Just like almost let me interactive feature on the website or something like that. Something that can help them.

We need to get it. Give them something first. Because even if somebody looked at Canada computing or many other hated their oftentimes Company will have something like, hey, You're interested in services, can we? You want to subscribe to our mailing list our our newsletter, whatever? Right in that process.

Bank, the hook is They don't care what they're giving you, it's The real values that they've now got your email address. And now it goes from, you know, sending out a newsletter from you know to 400 recipients to now, hope we get four thousand right, what a big difference, right?

John. Let's see how we can maybe take this to the next level. Like this particular idea. Maybe that banner that you already developed to have it on the website. And to get, like, Polish it or adjusted, a lot of it so that People can. Leave their contact to to book with us or to lead their contact to it, at least, get something.

But what's that? Something we need to develop that. It's either, you know, leave your contact to book. A free meeting type of thing or or leave your contact to send you. Something. But that's something we still have to think about. Is actually personally advertise it from artists or something muchas by ourselves.

There's many avenues here. QR codes that you place, you know, babies and See older and the cold, going back to that. There is like the other day, which i shared with, you would like to joanna is the Uh, like there is a business directory that we found. Uh, like has maybe more than like a thousand contacts in winnipeg.

And different businesses, right? And they're, they're Owner as well. So So i think we need to just get the ongoing and just check on them. Like yeah, the more we can call The more chances we will make something count, i think we'll have to make like 100 calls before we can get 10 leads and those 10 leads, maybe one of them will sign up as a customer.

And and include it, then maybe i don't want to overuse the example of tank Thursday. But is there an example that i know you put the banner up and sponsored over the brain? Brain, share nine or something. When i think data songs, yeah, it was like, okay, great, is that a chance to say hey will sponsor you and we'll get forward this sort of money or spring for pizza or whatever.

Is contact with the context. That's very smart although the right way because yes, Wayne probably have a list of people who are absolutely yes. And if we get that they have a letter, if you can tap into their list of great. That's a very good point. How it can we add these people to attend to our list?

And, and From. Yeah, so maybe that third line just becomes it, you know, build scalable sales process plus you know, You know, expand clearly list good point to break. Well, continue on here. Uh, what we would grab a bike and We we travel the discussion. Um, so you're going to tell us what you've gone for us.

We've got spaghetti there. That's awesome. Right now. Abdullah's quickly ripping up a meeting a white paper. We published on our website. How to automate, how to integrate chatchee chatting. What high school? I'm here. Let's say something. Place, what is that? It's going by hands. A good old techniques. So volcano estas, filipino spaghetti.

Waves are going there. Yeah, i know that it's thinking. Oh my third brain. Okay, turn on your stock first. So, tell us. How would you oh, do we need a big spoon for this? Maybe just ask, but there's some here. We might want to, um, it's a tick place that's called seasick.

Or what's it called? Head cheese, more or less blue good, you know that my girlfriend's Vietnamese, but she basically like kind of Oh, choice here. And phase small together. Then you have to, um, Are grilling it first? Go ahead guys.

That's this. Uh, so can you chicken pizza? This is I think these two are almost identical. Or yeah, chicken and veggies really meant for chicken veggies. Yes, on this healthy. Just a small pizza shop nearby. Yeah. My st. Name here. In this building the order. Ah, nice. Oh, that's right.

Um, Right, since you mentioned you have you'll be leaving shortly. So maybe we'll try to Wrap up here, some of the points. Before we get into the tech aspect of today's meeting, Um, But yeah. So uh

You know. We've seen some some of these things here before. So just we usually like to put it for potential investors and others to see what we have. An up to, he started really great initiatives, we have been co-sponsoring in the community. And, Um, Yeah, it really gave us exposure.

Gave us a chance to speak. Uh, give us a chance and i an opportunity to also meet others. Um, many talented speakers actually were hosted in these events. We like to play in the role in the community to just, you know, bringing people together and yeah whenever the chance presents itself.

We try to take that forward. Um, Yeah, so that's one of the big data science. Meetups. So these are our locations. Mainly we have two main locations and then we have two virtual ones. And, Yeah, we're really strategically located. I think, you know, between the north and the south Um, and i would like to certainly take more.

Take advantage. More of these presence area that we're in. What? I maybe the next few slides. You are really just it's just a little more information. You know, there were more tailored for For horizon computers when we were discussing with them, and actually, to give you guys a an insight, perhaps of that it went really well.

We had a good meeting last friday, not yet yesterday, but the one before, And was very insightful. This gentleman who will leave the company there. His name is Raj. He has been in business for like 20 plus years, 28, actually. And he leads a team of what 30 people.

Uh, They? He grew the company with two other partners. And, and i believe he's the one, he's the only one right now. He liked what we have. It, basically, the next steps for him was to It to engage, a professional valuation company, to basically, look at Areas and go through the numbers.

We engaged one locally gave them a gave us a preliminary. Idea how much our company could be worth, but they would like to still But there's a there's a lengthy process basically to get evaluation going and we're going to try to entertain that as we. As we evolve the conversation with this potential, why other buyers as well in other investors, So it's i just wanted to let you know that it's a hell.

It was a very healthy conversation, the gentleman, they're invited us for around two basically, another Round out after we. After we get some some more details to him. Um, There's lots that we're discussed, actually, we had, we spent two and a half hours guys, believe it or not, we met fortune up hours on teams.

From 3 p.m. i think until 5 30 or six? Yeah, on on friday, not lots when one before Is there any highlights? Maybe you want to? It comes to mind. Do we discussed a lot and he's It's a very well-rounded man. You know. Traveled the world. Yeah, right. Yeah, it's a whole panel there or just, right?

I'm done lying. And i, Yeah. Yeah i know what he's a Um, Is a Numbers. Numbers driven, for sure. Sure. He's understanding the yeah entire business. Yeah, he's been. They've had A retail shop before future shop. Like before, there was anything called future or even best spy, or any of these like Like, computer stores, right?

They've had a retail before then and they got out of the retail business. And then now they came back there, they bought an apple store. Not to get back into the retail, but it was more of a strategic. Come back so that they can get better at apple. So they bought like, an apple store just so they can strategically Uh, build that arm within the company, right?

So, It's a yeah in An interest? Yeah, it's the rose rise of idea, right? It's an interesting. Move from them as well. So, But they have, i would say that apples centric. Retailers or something or service business? Maybe there is not apple itself and saskatchewan. Perhaps there's no apple store like here, right?

Yeah. So they there's like a big store like it's known to be only apple like advance or something. So it's known to be the apple sauce. Yeah. Water vagina perhaps. I don't know, like the city games. Yeah, somewhere there. Yeah. But there's an apple store there. Like we have there, so it referred to as the apples store.

That. Yeah. But yeah some of the i guess some of the highlights of that conversation is There is a strong. Um, Interest from horizon to buy Canada computing. Conditionally. Uh, they want to evaluate the company. And, You know, evaluating a company. Even a smaller scanning community. It's not cheap.

I mean, yeah, or not a quick good to bring it professional company. That property valuates. Um, What. I guess again, the tangible intangible assets of the company is Is a process going to take time and effort, like a biology is a very financial during person. He's just trying it's that's his background.

Companies a CEO. Yeah. And he's not Uh, They're very nice guy. Don't misunderstand what i'm gonna say next but he's not open for others to lead the company. Like he mentioned. Again, my goal is to buy companies. They don't like co-leaderships and co-owners and coordinates was not even open to partnerships.

You're not even open to having like some of us or the company being on the decision table or on the, but he was up front about it. He's like, i'm gonna buy canon computing. My goal is to keep. The existing team happy as happy as possible to keep them stick around as long as possible.

Right. So That's, That's really where there's not like. He would never have a vision of Having a division called county computing. Heat the representation. He did he did commit our brand, right? I said you got a good brand. Yeah, i want to keep it. Your transition into horizon bread but he's like i'm going to keep the brand.

A little while. Got a good brand, at least in the Winnipeg Manitoba region.

Is it clear? And i'm sure he's pretty savvy. Is he? Is there a Driving reason, you think he wants as he's looking for presence in Manitoba perhaps. He said, he has already five people in Winnipe. It has a team.

I don't feel kind of part-time. He said they have customers. They have already owned on the ground. Yeah.

It's, it is a strategic acquisition, right? They take Like specializations expertise and kind of Expand that, right? So bring more managed services and gives a footprint in Well, if you think about it gives a footprint in Yeah, right. And with With some work in both Ontario alberta. Political, some of it, some of it is.

Have their location in Winnipeg is in one of the co-working spaces that we're not part of Osborne. There is a co-working space there. Um, they're in that location. That's their office. I'm going to be Yeah, so it's a healthy conversation. Well, we'll certainly try to continue the rounds. I guess it does take time for things like that to materialize, but there's not only approach, right?

It's not the only, I believe we've got lots more to do in candy computing, and we got our own potential with god.

You know, it is. It's an amazing thing that we have built. But it's still. Got a lot to go before. It is really a great. Um, so one approach, of course to find a company like this, they buy us out and, you know, Everybody moves forward. The other approaches of course, to continue to work organically on ourselves, by bringing investors, by bringing partners by expanding partnerships.

Uh, by opening up for More brilliant people to lead the company and and continue to be. At the table. To make decisions on how and where this company is moving forward to And and that has its own. Risks and it's on challenges but also it has its own rewards just like where we are today, right?

You know, Being able to fully see transparently, see across and through. And and Uh not to say that these things may not continue on when you are part of other companies, depending on their policy, depending on their mentality. Depending on how they do things, it may or may not be something that you can be.

Close to. Uh, so what i'm trying to say here, you know, there isn't much in terms of slide. If you just wondering, just really, those are what i wanted to share from a business standpoint. Um, but what i'm trying to get to here is Um, You know, i everybody on this table here today.

It has been an amazing teammate to work with it, and And you guys, Honestly, have earned Like, you know, your your I'm personable grateful to me. With you. Oh, and And you have also earned and made. You know. And your position to be also. And just have the right to decide.

If you would like to be on the leading team of this company on the awning ownership team, you really have You have Aaron basically your position. To be there. So so i want you to really exercise those rights and, you know, say, well what does it take to to have a seat at the company level?

What does it take if i were to bring in a few customers? And what does it take for me to promote this brand to my team of network? That's, Like i'm, you know. I have been in the country in the city for 14 plus years and i have built this much connections.

You've got many of all of you have been a lot longer than me. And i'm sure there is valuable networks that you have. What does it take for for? Communication to flow transparently across these networks. From and two, right? Both ways. To continue to grow this brand. This company.

Basically, it's an invite for you guys. To, to decide. Be more involved. Uh, So, We wouldn't have this meeting. I mean, let me ask. Why did you guys come on a Saturday? Here. Because You know, there there is you you believe For the spaghetti i think. Yeah, maybe that's one.

But uh, but but yeah, yeah we all came because we're we're driven to make something we're not sure. We have some answer things and me too, i have many answer to things. So, Yeah. Me, i have locks to work on. The company has lots to work on as well.

What do you guys think? Do I don't know if you're watching what time as well, you don't hold it for longer, but do you think we're Do you think this conversation? Is. How can we equit with this? How can we make ourselves louder? And then it's effective way.

I would then this is just outside, right? So is that You know. This conversation that you're having with horizon will say. It's going to open your eyes regardless of the overcome. Like if it's uh, Well, no thanks at least. It's a You've gone through a bit of the process, you understand, maybe some of the concerns that would, you know?

And, In the meantime, there's still a parallel work of Computers. Got to try to get better. Regardless, right. Whether it's, you know, Now, or for the future, right? So, i mean, it's one one shouldn't really under the two separate things. It's it's good because you still got to have goal so i'm going to go forward.

So

Makes sense. Uh, guess i've seen my point of what the svvcdc for, for example, and i don't know if i try to explain avoid a little bit. Do you think we would have potential people? Would, you know, or would you yourself? This thing because we want to apply, there's a process, right?

But we don't just simply apply if there isn't tangible interests, right? I'm just a reminder up to 45 percent, right is what you get, you get, not up to you, get 45 percent, you get 45 percent back in tax credit. Foreign for whatever you invest, right? So that's very good program, 25k you get worse?

Five percent of that back in tax credit, right? So, if you are owing, Manitoba tax this month, you get it back, two years back. Eight or ten years forward. Yeah, so if you paid to the last two years, this much of tax to my job, You would get that back in your next tax filing, right?

Up to 45 percent. Maybe that's what you mean by up to up to 45% of what you invested and if you still have a little more room, you will still continue to get tax credit in the next eight years up to 45 percent Is that making sense? What's the caveat though?

You give the money back obviously but it's interesting. How was it your investing? So it's it's basically say you wanted to invest in a Manitoba company that's registered in the spcdc. It's my total government program. Okay? University hockey. The government factor, but to basically stimulate entrepreneurship and keep the business economy flowing they are Making incentives, you're creating incentive programs for local investors to invest in those companies.

And their way of doing that is giving them 45 percent. Tax credit of major attacks credit. Of what the invested. So does that work every year? Like you say going back to years, two years back and eight years forward, but until you get the 40% buck, but you threw out a number of 25 grand.

For instance When you get 45 percent of 9.5 two years and then back to forward. 45 percent over 25k or is it over so say, 10k, in my top tax rate in the last two years, you would get 10k. Okay. Uh that's and you'll get up to 45 percent of the 25k.

So what's 45 percent of 25k? Let's say it's 12k. Yeah, something like that. Sure. So eleven k, is 45 percent of the 25k. For example, let's assume. You would get a new pay 10k in my talk attacks in the last two years you would get 10k. And you would still have to get one more game.

Uh, or so and you would get it in the next year. Once you Once you accrue those taxes, so Because you pay 10k, they will give you 10k back. But in the next year say you owe them, i talk about taxes, 1k or 10k, you would pay what you owe and they will return to you.

Uh that one game that's remaining right now automatically everybody here is who is working a full time on a t4? They there's my talk about tax being paid on their behalf right and there is also federal tax being paid on their behalf. So whatever you pay that. That's part of what you will get back.

Two years back. And then eight years old. So if you haven't never played taxes in the last two years or you don't simply don't, you're not in the bracket then. You can get that 45 percent back in the future and the future. Yeah, they will never pay you money.

Free. Basically. They'll never pay your free money. What they saving you is money. Yeah. They're saving you not. They're not paying no money. They're saving you. Yeah. That's sort of. That's probably the best. Yeah, yeah. So why i'm bringing this is i'm just wanting to take your opinion. You guys are the closest to network to the company.

Is it effective for me to go spend the effort to apply and qualify the company there. It's quite like the general procedure, i even spoke to that program coordinator from the government should equalify, but you just have to do the application as it worth it for us to do it, would you or you know of a negative on your network?

Think that it's worth want to invest here? And become part of the ownership team. Make a decisions. Potentially, get get some return. Now you, of course, might by the investor you want to okay? Sure, i'm interested. But what do i get? And that's about the question you saw our numbers earlier and we're headed in a positive.

You know. Uh, direction. I do expect. I i do have a rough idea. For whoever wants to invest to get roughly 10 to 15 percent in return a year. And the next years from whatever they invested, Whether we do it on a monthly basis or an annual basis, but i do for envision that we will start to see those nice margins.

So, i'm I'm sharing this with you because again, you deserve to to be no to know these opportunities. There's the other ways, of course, i'm starting our company to others, but why sell? If we have a, if we have a good company in place here, that's moving in a good direction where we can Uh, control and maneuver and And drive and even invest and get returns.

Uh, versus selling them being out and So, Maybe we'll do, i don't know. Yeah, let's see here like i know my family and the lowest time. For example, we have some interest to inject some money in the near future into the company, to just get it to a good places to basically have four, creating the scalable sales process to afford some more processes in place.

And and we are like my family, for example, they say oh why should you know, we have a lot of capital, what should i put it here? Well, i tell them, well, it's a good place for you to, you know, to get some some return and so on. So i'm as cautious about this As.

You know, because we're going to be putting some our own family time, family resources as well. Uh, But that's from my perception about your comment about a quick and no just do it around 10. No, that's good. So yeah. So like so as as a And you don't have to be a manitoba resident right to.

Well you can invest from anywhere but any qualify for this plan. Yeah, to qualify the company has to be a managerial problem, and but the investor investor is to get some return. They have to be made out of interest management of investors. They have to be already have to be contributing to the tax economy in Manitoba.

Well, question are they are they written in as a director? Uh, That's a very good question. The director has to be remember. Manito. Yeah. One of the we'll find out, i don't know. Your question rod is. You have to be a director for this program? No, no. Would that that?

Like the question was about residency. If you're written in as a director, I don't think you have to be, but somebody has to be Our director has to be for Manitoba. So, If that makes sense for a match over company now, who knows what this program needs. My questions would probably be.

What does it mean? What is it? Translate what is your dollar's translate into in terms of shares also? What is it? Translate What does it mean for your existing shareholders? That are pretty quiet. Very good questions. That's an excellent question. So the preliminary conversation team, which we we're going to invest on cash roughly about 10k to get a professional valuation made for the company.

Uh, but we haven't paid this much but the preliminary conversation with the valuation. Uh said that our company roughly is worth this much. Okay, so Hope that gives you an idea, right? So, what if you? Invest. Yeah, so whatever you invest basically. So that do you guys are you know what that means?

Maybe i'm happy to expand. I think it's self-explanation maybe it needs an example like Okay, so somebody says, great i got i'll do 25 thousand dollars of investment. What does that mean? Percentage wise Good question. So so roughly that's probably what would be maybe under five percent? Under five percent.

But, you know, there is furthermore team, you know, because we are a small company and you guys have played a significant control to bring the company to where it is. You know, whether my advice or by being committed to what you're doing. Uh, We can work things out right, you know.

So for example, if let's say 50k equates to 5 percent actually, let's do a quick number. Here you last 25k, right? Let me just see here. What does that equate? How to do the math for this. Let's see here. Times a five. So if you want to do a five percent, that would be 40k Based on this number.

Okay, so 40k with equate to 5 percent, 25k would be probably less than five percent. We can, you know, if say you want to invest like, you know, to 25k. We can make something work. That may get it to popular present if that makes sense. So we can say, okay, well you you want to invest 25k Because that's what you have.

And you think you want to keep your sort of restoration of five percent, We can look at maybe other intangible way to invest, right? Uh, one international way to invest, is really coming on Saturdays like this to, to Left the company, right to think of and strategically position the company in a good position.

One of the intangible way to invest is to maybe spend some hours, right? And left to make sure the company is moving in the right direction. Why did we come on a Saturday, not on during the weekdays because there's fire supplies, right? It's impossible for us to have such a meaning while our customers servers are done.

Or somebody's not able to get to the email or whatnot. So that's why we choose to sometime. Do a little bit of after hours and weekends. So that's intangible investment, right? So you could So if you can think about it this way, And i'm only like welcoming People, who, who really like i would want to say, I would want we would want to start a criteria of course as a team, if we were to purchaserate an awning piece of this company for who can also come in the future, but this moment we're very small that were not having so much of a criteria Beside of.

You know, a bit of financial bit of commitment and better for good characteristics. And and, you know, you prove and you're proving yourself to to one or to take this company to the next level. The genuinely not not wanting to hurt or damage. This company. But yeah. Maybe we'll do a quick crown.

So right. Any any questions comments? Good. Good questions. Yeah. Just what does it mean with the existing? Sure. There's other outside of Abdullah. Yeah, very good question. So that existing shareholders you've got muhammad and muhammad wants to exist. Certainly he has and just full transparency here with your team.

Division. Right now is muhammad has 10 percent manage and has 25 percent. Abala has 65 percent. I'm i don't know why i have that many honest image. I'm the office manager of the company, i do between me and a dollar. There is a little bit of a cleanment that we sort of go on and we have this designer but i was like Steve Jobs.

Okay, half percent for me and i wasn't taking any citizen when i when when the company was in the establishment process. Uh, and there were a bit of a complication for me to to own and And run the company, and also work towards my citizenship. So But that's a separate story.

So basically, just, if you're curious of what the heck we are in, That's a special background. Yeah, so right, in terms of that other owners, Anybody could walk into those owners and offer them and they will. They will. Go out buy out, they'll pay they will sell. Yeah but there is but that's that's goes to their benefit they would get a capital game.

The company would not benefit as much from the money. Uh, and they would get their shirts. So, that's one way. Of course for somebody. You could go and bargain. Hey mr. Muhammad, i know you have another boat and you want to sell out by your shares. All pretty much.

They will sell their chance. That goes to a capital benefit to them. What we're trying to do here is is raise the capital benefit for the company so that we have a little bit of cash to Move the company followers. How can we do that when we we need to issue additional shares.

Essentially, that dilutes. Everybody's Shares a lot. So if abdullah owns 65 percent, he would end up wanting. Maybe 62 percent. Mohammed. He would own maybe a little bit less, just because we're issuing more and we're increasing we're sharing that by with more people. Of the answers question, right? No.

Absolutely. I wasn't sure if there was that thought up. Eventually you guys buying them out perhaps too. Well, you know, if i have the cash i would buy them out. I mean, sometime you would you would wonder, okay. What's the what's a good use of my cash at this moment, right?

Yeah, it's well, i need to build the company. They're not impacting company negatively, though. They are interested in how many in particular is interested in. Selling magazine has lots to offer massaging. He's uh, Times on, makes it different. But imagine has been in cisco for 12 plus years, and his original management for sure is, is very wise, man.

Very popular engineer. That's what you finished and he works in in an strategic sales and partnership. We have very limited amount of time with him just because of the time zone and how busy he is and sometimes also helps you are doing the week but the genre has lots of wisdom.

So i'm not really eager to certainly offer him and you know, and he's also interested to give when he can Uh, so if we just open up the bridges of communication between him and us, he has lots to add to the table. As a matter of fact, That pricing that the hourly rate of our company and how it evolved and how we calculated.

He played a really positive role in an impacting it initially before he joined, we were our hourly rate was advertised to be like 65 dollars or seventy five. And we used to always sell at 30 dollars in 40 hours an hour. And, And because we thought okay well if you know if my salary is 20 dollars an hour or 25, then if i sell for 35 and i'm winning but we did not see through that overhead.

We never really calculated our overhead and our minute. So help us third he helped us create like i really nice exercise to show us. What is it? Truly costing us to sell the hour to do an hour of service to our customers and that blew my mind. And at that time, it showed us that we cannot sell below 85 dollars.

That's like six years ago. Because if we sell below that we're losing, we're literally losing with a customer and And he opened our eyes and said, you guys are like, you're losing your your. So when you it's not like i thought at the beginning, oh, if i'm selling a little more than what i'm getting paid then then that's probably a profitable.

But never you. So we were not accounting to the utilization. Because you're not 100, you're you're you're working 40 hours, but you're not necessary selling 40 of those hours. So many things did not were not accounted for and help us. So anyways, as young, a good gentleman and Uh, but yeah, if the right opportunity to to sell, he would absolutely sell now.

Right. Any airports and we're john and and then probably sorry that i'll probably have to go right over here. But also what does that you know as a drop that criteria? What does it mean to have a You know, an active partner versus an active partner because i mean you're here really you guys are in the trench, right?

And you've got two partners that aren't and that's probably, you know, it hasn't been a detriment but it's it's certainly not making it easier for you guys, right? So they know for other people joining, we want to talk to people somebody just showed up with money. Yeah they own a bunch but they're not contributing anything is that fair isn't who knows, right?

Yeah because there is a You know have to keep in mind is a greater good here of trying to get funds back into the company, right? So Absolutely. Yeah. We at some point. As i mentioned, how much we'll get up. But but Mazin with their opportunity, he will also be willing to just because of the time zone, by the way.

Just if you're curious Mazen, He has family here and he was going to migrate, but his migration our immigration did. All the owners by the working incidents, if you're curious. But imagine never made it to to live here. That basically, Uh, yeah, family challengers. And then it basically did not make him make it possible or feasible, so it is he's settled there.

But his plan, he invested in a company because he wants to stay here, and he wants to play a role in company for it. Muhammad was here naturally, but he moved you to his work. Right. Appreciate your contribution and your your participation Do you think we should apply for this?

Uh i think anything potential absolutely but i will say this, it really comes down to what you guys want to do. Right? If you're going to have an offer on the table of what that means, it's like How serious is that, right? Where do you guys want to be?

And you know, three years right? Is it like you it's one thing to say, Yeah. Ideally we've got a company that's all across Canada and stream really well. Okay. Right. But if that's not the case, what do you want to want to do with Canada? How big is that vision of candy?

If it is if it's something you can't bear to see your baby sold. Then go for it. You know what i mean? And and i sat it on some things that were about mergers and acquisitions and they said, You know, there's been at the table a few times trying to help an acquisition.

And in the end. They couldn't sell that baby. Couldn't get rid of it. They wanted to see that play out to fruition and so so that's I don't think anybody in that in this room. Yeah. Pager. Well, that's a baby. Very, very bad and very good but i don't necessarily have an answer for it.

What's i am one? Here is the word, is, if we Like in this network here are there. Okay. Can we uh is anybody interested in basically stepping up and taking a few steps forward? In. Owning a piece of the bar, is this a good thing even to do, right?

Or So, i like the initiative that you asked, Everybody, like you said, Um, your plants making sugar, you know, for us to know where we at right now. Um, To applied stress in CBC. I think it's a good idea. We don't You know, we we I don't know, i would like to to Invest, but i'm not sure play a lot of Okay.

Fair comment and we'll take it quickly. Handy. And travel. What's your comments? Yeah. Um, It's all very new to me. Yeah, hardly ever invested in anything, to be honest. And i don't have a whole lot of money to do. So it's not something, you know, it's not like that.

I'm totally closed off from it and i have, you know, i have minuses my family. Okay support. But yeah. You know. I'm not necessarily opposed to doing so, but Just kind of finding how i can do that. That's that's why i'm, you know, it's very, very early, very young for you.

And if i'm in your shoes, i would say. Oh, hey guys, you know, just barely starting to work here. So That's the fair comment. Thanks, thanks honey. Oh yeah, echo a lot. What he said there but yeah, i for sure. Be interested in. It definitely. I also don't have a lot of saved money too, to invest, but definitely would be interested for sure.

It's a safe place where you want. Yeah, You have a minimum requirement for that. Yeah. That's what i want to know like minimum requirement for how much you have to invest that that might be determined by them. As much as you guys might have a mom a number in mind, but they might have some.

Do you recall any minimum for that? I don't, i'll check. Yeah, they might, you know. Yeah, but can be either through them of course through them is there's an incentive but also, it can be outside of the program. Yeah. But that's, that's a good question. I'll check on the minimum and get get back here to everybody shortly.

But yeah, that's that's great. I appreciate the question there. It's determined based on them john, i guess. And Uh, from us here. I mean we would welcome anyone who's genuinely interested. Of course, it doesn't make sense to do the all the paperwork and engage laws and whatnot for like 2k or 5k or 10k.

I mean think it might be okay, sure starting now. But i think what rod mentioned there about the 25k, that's probably a good starting point. If you think that, you know, you would want to own a piece of the power, i want to control the company, this future and, you know, Do a sweat a little bit to take it even forward.

What's our goal. How how much Finding our investment. We're looking for. As a company. I think that's a very good question about you. Excellent conversation here. I i think we would want to have like as a company to just take ourselves to the next level investing in some of these initiatives.

We talked about here, And we want to raise probably about 200k as a company. We don't raise about 200k. And funding, whether it is from family, funding or some friends, and some other people like who are interested around here, And our, our promise to them. Is to hopefully return.

10 to 15 percent. And and i i do have some calculation that supports how we're going to get that 10. 15 percent back Uh, some of these calculations. Backed by the fact that i showed earlier but there are more in-depth calculation that tells you okay. I can see that enter 15 percent to come.

So it's there is a lot of Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's it. Yeah. All right everybody. Okay, thanks a lot for lunch. Let's see a lot. Thank you. Stay in touch. Yeah. Have a good one. Um, yeah, i guess that. That's That's on that side. I would just give me one second.

All right. Yeah. Maybe take yeah, you guys want to take a? I think it's a good moment to break. And then after the meeting will just flip the hats and get to the Tech aspect of things. Um, but yeah, if you guys have questions or want to converse further on this happy to share more insights, You know.

They, they say, if you want to like be a Going to, you know, just Different lessons for people who want to grow their wealth, they say well you got to connect with wealthy people, right? You know go they want to go connect. What people ask them how can i help you?

That's what you're asking. You don't tell them. Ask them for money, don't answer but you ask them. How can i help you, right? And For my network is very limited in in the city, right? But many, many others may have a little, you know, you got to ask these people who are quite well, how can i help you?

What can i what what value can i add to you? And you know if you have some skill sets, you want to try to match your skill sets with their needs. And take it from there, so, You know, an invite. To connect with with your Lubricate, those networks, those connections with those And people.

You might know of your networks. Have a little bit of wealth. And, and You know, get the name across right? Yeah, we want to build something great. And we want to keep it solid. We're gonna It's Now, there's lots to be mention here. I think, well, we'll take a pause and Except those, it's good to know them.

Yes.

Pretty good.

Foreign.

Don't worry about work. Yeah. All of us manage. Oh,

I'm gonna smoke. No. Don't do it. So, that's okay.

Ever been to a non-such, really? No, i haven't been there been a superms so christmas. It's what? I'm going there tonight. I think they have like, more games. Yeah, i pretty good things about it so but it was good to be carry. A few of my work. Yeah, we have the book three three weeks now.

Wow, really? Yeah. Because we tried to do it a week in advance and then it was good. Then this kind of crazy, but Yeah. I've never been some. A lot of worker i don't. Two terms is good, though. That's probably one of the best best in the city. Probably.

Yeah. One one big. Into one big city. One great city. Yeah. I don't know. Is that off of canister? Uh, no. It's Nearly pull apart. Definitely heard of camp picture pretty good. Yeah, i don't.

I don't even really like like drink beer though like i don't drink too much, so

I don't like it was the beer that we carry from. Uphills. But you guys think so far? Lots of surprises here. Oh, good information. Very good. Yeah. But that's a little more excitation stuff. Yeah, anybody's overwhelmed here, anyone is leaving the company, definitely a lot, but i learned, hopefully, we don't lose your Their fashion here or your that's the last thing.

Or intent, my intention has To create from this.

My name is good lots of stuff. I didn't know about. So, It's good to kind of give up. An insight on some things. I'm glad to hear. Any on your side. Information. Like sometimes it's good because sometimes i am skeptical about certain aspects and Financials. You know what my spa is looking like and that sort of thing.

So That's, It's even for me like, when i was going through exercise of creating these slides, And i don't know what, i don't know, right? Because i'm not seeing this every day. Uh, in different places. So, So i look at this. Oh okay. That's not bad. You know, we're we have a good.

Good figure here. We just need to know how to multiply this and Yeah, there are a number of strategies that were trying to To to bring and create to raise the bottom line. Yeah. Sales. It's one of the things that i certainly. You know, i want to Pursue it a little bit differently.

As we grow. We want to multiply the effort that we do. In in sales. There is the i'll show you maybe guys something that's might be relevant.

But uh, yeah, let's see here with Once once everyone comes back, we will switch how to just get to the jam and MDM stuff like Until everyone is here. I'm just gonna tell you guys what's something here.

This is the fun yesterday. It was like two two servers that i went down. Oh really? It was it. Boxing issues. Yesterday was like that and believable. Yeah, it's fine. There's just there's Yes, they all is collectively that issues. They're once the right thing. Um, how did the vaccine thing though, actually?

Yeah. The cold henry, for the fox saying, um, Yeah, we established our facts account. But the forwarding i ended up having to spend like an hour and a half or so with that just chasing different parties chargers initially. But then it's well and even with bell, i spent like an hour in the color or something.

Just you it's crazy. And then i ended up being in a spot where they told me what that count is suspended. I said what the service is still running, like the they have internet. I said yeah, it's going to be interrupted, probably in the near future, but it's suspended, there is an overview on the count of eight hundred dollars.

We can't start recording for you. So i sent an email to at some of the, it's an email to dollar told them. Well, he needs to get somebody to call. Yeah, they're not sure what the story is. What happened to Bradford? I think you worked on or dashboard One of the connectors we worked on.

It's the same thing happening here as well. Right with their faxing. Yeah. So we need to just switch their boxes or fox. And because i was working on one of the i was working on that course clinic and you're working on Bradford. Pharmacy. Yeah. So i we needed to send a text and i ended up sending the tech to Danforth and it's a bit of a drive between both just created a more mess and i'll felt so about then it's like i said, okay?

And like in the background, i was actually working on. Lots of tasks for hunting. And like, you guys saw this email, i was meant to really make some progress on it, so Like, yesterday, i may be part of 20 different emails or 25 feet or something but it certainly not what i wanted a day to go but i thought it's going to be slow but but it's all good there don't no don't care about it all you know so this is kind of funny it's it's where we are, you know it's that far like we're in the firefighting moment that's that's what.

But yeah, it's we manage i guess we survived a day. It's you a good job. Driver there. Yeah, you did. At least we got. To crawl is back up and running a piece now. So the day is not over. Yeah. Yeah, that that's Which was okay. Yeah, we got Through it.

Cuts here or whatever. Yeah, i think the most part for that you just get a contact the ISP. Here's the Contacts and difficult or sorry as our backs and they might give you the they just port the number for use that they're recorded. Yeah, stuff. The ported for that other location but that's like an involved process.

Oh, it's not ported yet. Okay, i thought it is. Okay, no, it's green. It's being Forward that thing forward and definitely. And they recommended to do that for some reason. Okay. To look at it again. So, before we quickly switch the hat here, the team will talk about this.

Uh, directory here. So recently, i found this site to offer. A huge business directory. To. Yeah, local for just basically have all the businesses in Winnipeg very much. Are in here and they are listed in a very nice way. Like they have a Here, we got. So they have like a different categories, right?

It's like a, you know, it's a business listing. And my intention is to. And some businesses have names. Obviously you can see then the name of the owner, the name of the executive director, so when you call, you know who to speak with, My intention team. Is to contact everybody here.

To generate interest. Uh, tell them who we are. What are we doing? Check on them. Approach it in the most. Positive possible way. That we can that that can allow for a conversation to take place. Uh, we will can create a script we can Go through it. The goal is not to sell them.

The goal is not too. Get them out of contract. The goal is just to check on the businesses, right? As a company. As a as a local business here, we need to know how are the businesses doing around us. What are the challenges? What are the pain that are there?

They're going through from a text standpoint or even from their business standpoint in order down? And if we are lucky, if we're lucky try to schedule them for A meeting with, with me. To basically talk more about their Technical challenges or problems. If they are not happy with their current technical provider.

Uh, if they're happy, that's great. Check that box and spreadsheet or an assistant that we process will create. And if you are able to get their current, IT company, that's awesome. And then move on to the next. Um, After making like a few of those, it would start to give us an idea.

Oh, okay. Well we see these are the successful companies in the market. Oh, these are the companies that are not successful. These are the businesses that are struggling. Then we start to you, might get an answer, a business say it says oh we are struggling but we're not interested right now.

Alexa connect later on. Okay, well, you check that box right and Uh, we cannot know what we don't. No, without Reaching out, right? And we want to make this. Uh, We want to get to results really quick. At least, for For the next few weeks. So again, it's not very complicated.

Just really calling. We can create a process. You're not there to close the deal. You're not there to close the sale. You're not there to even have all the answers. You're there to just see if there is interesting. If there is it just to connect just to connect note down these, we can create it.

I'm going to be working on on this. An as i mentioned i do have a call. So next week with with a sales squash my first time having a code with her, i'm hoping for her to give me some ideas. I'll tell her that we're trying to do this in the team and advice.

Working basically farm also and their theme. Just to raise that bottom line that i showed you in the numbers. Do you guys think you can help in this? If you maybe like once i'm not going to you, we still have customers to serve so we're not going to be able to stick an entire time.

But i do want to still squeeze ourselves a little bit and push this exercise because We've been on it. We've been talking about for a while and we're not able to move it off the ground. How many customers did we have last month? Last two months, last six months, almost zero, right?

We need to inject a few new customers or at least few opportunities on the table every month. Even if we don't cause them. But at least we know we're talking with them, right? There's something that's going to, that's expected to come down the road. But right now, if you ask me, what's coming down the road, i told you.

Much. Maybe a little bit of clubhouse, whereas the working on that. And, but there has to be like more. Because you can see, it takes time like Up house, for example, you know, It's taking time for things to mentalize ladko company, right? It's taking time to materialize, we did that small call for them but But now there's nothing, that's so we need to have like a lot of these Yeah, i'm sure.

Question. If somebody. Connect with us and what did a meeting? Do you have a specific time or day that you wanted to schedule those meetings? The simple answer to you Jonah is there's a link that you can book with me right? And you have that accessible a lot. Everybody can get could see this The the long answer we still have to work through a process, we still have to come up with our process from A to Z with you know.

Okay you call there's a spreadsheet as it is a system. So we still want to fine tune that and i'm open for ideas and suggestions, but the simple answer I think there's a booking link, you know, you have it. And i think the team have it to That shows you quickly, that ability, you can put We can book anyone using that link, right?

And, We take it from there. Okay, well Appreciate the positive intake, Trevor you have as well. Yeah. Okay. We can do this. We need everybody to participate. I think we need to, like, just like what we did today. Come together. We can even book their book this boardroom and we can just be called calling one after the other.

And then we can just compete. Block for hours or so. Try to cross a number of names. Repeat this every week. And i'm sure we will start to see some really good names. Uh, okay, so my, then my homework is to start to do the planning phase of this, see how we're gonna orchestrate things, and, and hopefully you start to engage you Very soon.

On what's next and notice something going on this list that just this shortlist that you're looking at here, every one of them got a custom website. Right. Like, think about that for a moment. What is that? What does that tell you, right? Like every one of them got Like dot mb.ca.ca.com, right?

You know, yeah there's lots of them. Yeah, like and everything every one of them got a, got a phone number almost like a even a lot of them got faxes too like Like look at that, right? So and you guys i know some some people might be just another preserve site i thought that okay.

Well, would i be interested intruding if i call whatnot? I actually looked it out the other day. The Canadian laws allow for cold calling Set for people on the do not call list. So what brings the government has developed a do not call list? And i'm trying to sign up so we can have access to it.

Yeah. And so, in government, say, you're more than welcome to cold call, anybody unless they are on that, you know, who's on a do not call this. So i'm we're gonna have. So the access to that. Yeah, finalists. And then we'll just send them emails that

Send you by mail. Yeah, do not call last canada. So, basically, they have got this and yes, but but then, now you're gonna be boiling the castle, the right? They can stamp hold her legislation. Yeah. There's another one. Cancel. Okay, or something? Yeah. So this is the, the do not call list and basically, i registered i'm waiting for their approval.

And then they will send us a list that we can just basically double check if if we're calling our blessed or not. Um but again, what we're doing is not exactly that we're not directly selling, right? We're not calling to directly promote services. We're just having a check on the business.

You're saying hello? Yeah, that's it. Yeah, even if they are listed, yeah, we're not like this is talking about telemarketers. Yeah, we're not telling marketers, you know, like it's not that's getting to know. That's it. We're just kind of local. You can like stand up, always having the green light to call like, you know, hey, we're your neighbor.

Yeah. We're just having informal chat with them. That's where there's quality. If it's relevant, absolutely. It might not even apply. So we're trying to Kind of maximize. Are we gonna allocate any money for, for sales or like, are we gonna try different like methods or we just gonna go just through the book and call them?

Because i know we push back the community center thing. I don't know if it's going to do that purpose like other communions of advertising electronics. I heard that you can face Canada, opposed to give away your flyers. You know, that for business to business. Right there, is that. So yeah, there are It sure.

But like the, this process here. Like i wanted to get more real. I want to reach out to people. On a connect with the decision makers, the businesses that were eventually going to write, right? Right. So i would like to create a bit of a spike of that. It was in the next short while because we do, we are, you could say, we are and we're desperate for some really good customers.

To raise that bottom line. So if you are looking at the time that i have and we have as a team versus and how much we could do. And what's the most effective thing to do? I would like to choose the most effective. If you tell me, it's sending the postcard.

Is the most effective. I will tell you. Yes, let's do that. But if we were to less than a number of things and go through, what's the most effective? Is very costly driving and whatnot. I think it's very we can we can play it very smart when we head that And henry for the community center, probably we can do this in parallel as soon as we execute on this, a lot of it.

I think we want to certainly have our because, yes, when you are called calling, especially you circle calling the surrounding so you can tell, hey, we're You know, we have established our presence that community center or Chocolate that way. And when we called call, i mentioned earlier, we could tell them what the manageable attack week.

That's something cool to share with them, right? Many of them, may not know about it. And we actually are considering both sponsoring that myitoba tech week. We'd like to tell you what cost behind this. We're running also at the event. Perhaps we might run a training session during the native attack week.

About maybe office apps. Or one note or productivity engine, right? Productivity, or maybe even LLM or tragibility use case or something like right, right? We still have to shape how that is gonna Look like okay. Well that's it team. I spoke for a lot. Thank you so much. Although i'm gonna pass to you lead us through the mdm and the avm and the jump or what we like to accomplish today.

I think we have got the team maybe before another Hour and a half or so you guys are good for till five everybody. I believe it just like 4 30, but, okay, an hour and a half, so, how would you like to see and maybe we'll collaborate? Like, you know, maybe henry and travel also and i will participate with it.

Yeah, i know that's good to sure. Do it. I gotta go thank you Joanna. Thank you so much. You know, like this? You need help, gonna put backing some things. Well, there is a lot, it take some take some That's, Yeah. Trash for the food. What do you want to do?

What you want to cook next time? Just let me know that sport. Yeah. Well, you can. Yeah. What's the? Um it's like sticky rice but it's purple. It's like a dessert. Oh, it's called i think. This is sticky rice. And yeah, there is a different colors, too. Uh, it's just um, coconut milk anywhere.

And goodness rates. Yeah. Yeah. Adjustment. Glutenants. Yeah. Goodness, it's fine powder. People. Yeah, made from rice. It's mainly rights, right? Yeah, yeah. Nice. It's like a sticky rice. It's a deserting. Yes, nice. There's a lot of piece of church. Number two, who's coming? On your most under most i, you know, i actually use it quite a bit for Spot checking scripts like posture scripts and also summarizing.

So for example, i think i've showed you this guys this before like i would go Say like a youtube video like this and then i have a little chrome extension. Uh, it's called glass. I have another one here, called the chargeby summary, but what? Yeah, so what i do i actually Go like this.

Um, I click AI summary or I can copy the transcript. So, if the video has been Has been uploaded in the last 72 hours. They won't be in transcript available yet. If it's a new video, you have to wait at least 72 hours for the transcript to be available.

And then i go into all videos any video. So, any video that has been uploaded for at least 72 hours and youtube video, i grabbed the transcript. And then i go into open AI. And i say, Summarize the following, And, Five bullet points. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Thank you john much, appreciate it.

Summarize the following and five bullet points. And then i just Paste it in, and i go like this. I don't know if i'm Doesn't look like i'm logged in my day or something once again. Cookies. Yeah, i'm just gonna And like, that's I understand the idea. Oh yeah that's cool.

I'm just gonna log in.

Yeah, i think i have. Yeah. So my google

Yeah, so i go like summarize. So it's very good in summarization The following. Five bullet points. Uh, go like so. I don't know why i'm using 3.5, but It just defaulted and it gives me a summary of that video that youtube video. Yeah, technically i didn't really have to watch the video.

You know what i mean? I mean i don't have to i mean the thing is what i do. I tend to actually summarize the transcript first, And then if something peaks my interest, i would go back and watch the video. You know so that way i can kind of again increase my productivity instead of watching one youtube video a day i can watch.

Yeah you 10 i don't really watch 10 i summarize 10 you know what i mean. So Uh but, but so i went here for example, this morning And i and i in the comment section, i put a big summary. I commented with a big summary of that video. I find a lot of people actually don't know about this.

So what i did, i use an add-on that connects to my chat, you get account called summarize. I click that that's slightly different adder. Gives me a big summary with with Relevant emojis with it. So i took that i just caught i like i copied that And i just put that in the comments.

So next time, i watch the video, if i come across this video, i know that i've been here before. Right introduction just and you know, so i mean introduction just in founder of patch might bc he developed solutions. He worked as a former microsoft engineer. I don't need to know that, you know, i mean, but it's good.

Yeah, it's a nice, nice to know but i can go in here. Setting up in tune, purchasing demonstration, purchasing new domain, via cloud flare. So, i'm kind of reading it before even watching the video. You see? He's another video, another example of Watching automating app deployment via gem with gem.

So, i Watched a 50 minute video under five minutes. How did i do that? We charge of you summary, right? Right, so same thing. I went in here. Unfortunately this This youtube channel, they they turned off comments so i can end my own comment. But you kind of get the idea is that i'm watching these Long format videos and i'm learning quite a bit in a very short time frame.

It's been and this is like the thing is, there's a ton of free material on youtube for any kind of topic, you think about And it's just, It's just, no, not enough time to watch all of them. It's just it's, it's not not, it's not practical, but yeah, but that's a good good question.

Uh, Trevor. So, 900 was. Oh, this one, this is a I think this is like more azure Azure AI fundamentals. Yeah, yeah. There's actually a search for that. Well, that might be correlated to copa that you were talking about a i maybe that's more a German. That's like infrastructure LLM like islr, you know what i mean?

Not not co-pilot. Yeah, yeah. But i see what you're saying, yeah. Um, So maybe yeah, maybe i'll head over to Just firefox over there where i have my i guess my Well, you know, it would be a good outcome of today. If all of us can do the jam 100 and get certified.

Sure not now, yeah, it's just sorry. I just got that. That's a bit of an over maybe I and you have been going through it, maybe Henry you start because you have been actually going. You're the most committed to this. From us, i believe you've been putting some time, right?

How is that going for you? That's really well. More. So i haven't actually Like dive into jamp as much and the different features and stuff that they offer. A lot of it is like a good refresher on iOS and Mac OS and and it just the terminal and introduction scripting.

And it gives a kind of a little bit of a deeper dive on. The operating systems as well. So i'm refreshing myself on that first and foremost. And then it will get into gentlemen. The different things that it offers. Makes sense. So you would say, would you say that you're halfway maybe through this?

Materials. Yeah. Okay. Um, for a timeline monthly, trying to think you like a month, right? Because those things, but John 400. There we go. Depends how quick you would take a month. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Oh, because there still is a lot of information that goes through.

I was thinking we could just all get certified today. Well, i mean, i don't know i guess it's not processary. I just throw 100 bucks at it and see if you You know can pass or whatever? I think you need 75 to pass. Okay. Yeah i guess that's true.

That's a good point. Yeah, waste of money. Yeah. So Actually, on that note, don't pay 100 bucks. We have promo code. So, and she can give us. If you guys wouldn't like too many go through one today and to just get an it just one, of course, can go and then we all as maybe that's a good use of time because she said she can give us as much as we need.

So do you guys want to try like all of us challenge one? At the same time, we was one. Maybe okay. What's your plan about for the next? Yeah, right now and just give it a chance. See, what kind of questions they have and how would they have to prioritize it?

Okay. So maybe they fail hard or we barely pass or i don't know. No, i don't know how long the exam is but i do you roughly. What do you anticipate? How long would see it? Being longer than 25 minutes? I would agree. Okay. You want to try them out challenge the exam.

You can challenge it as many times, so as you will be rough for Is it going to show on my resume? If i feel, i'm just kidding. That's a good one. No, i'm just kidding. I'm just Okay, so let me try to find out how to go through the exam process.

Then you scroll down the pages to say get started. Oh you are there okay yeah that should be an exam get started, right? Introductions. Okay. About the exam. I don't want to make them to schedule it or there's a practice example. Okay. A practice exam it's wise to go through our practice examples.

Yeah. Select iOS apps exist in a self-contained environment, called an app sandbox, true, or false true. But how do i select that? Like is there a just a guess, you know? It's oh, okay. So answer is having a lot. Maybe then open up a new tab, just with the answers and then we'll put.

Yeah. One where here? Just open a new town. Oh, And, I think that shows you that answers. Right? Okay, so let's go back now. Okay, so i'm beginning to do that. Okay, so let's see how swiping down from the top right on? An iOS will access which feature your control center.

Well, Proud that, you know, swiping down. Oh, that's the iphone. Okay, top right? Yeah, right control center. I think they mentioned that but i forgot about that. An apple id is required to complete iOS setup assistance. True. No, it's not required. No sports. Okay. So you can complete that setup set without an apple, you don't need an Apple ID, you can bypass it.

Interesting, i'll get, you know,

Yeah, i guess they want to make it, make it accessible for most people, right? Along with apps which features can be added to them. It's wages. It widgets sorry. No, that's why i'm the only iphone user. I don't know anything. So which feature can be added iOS home screen, that gives acts edition Okay, you guys guess.

Yeah. Like world clock and batteries. I think we're just yeah. Complications with the hand, the delete an app from an iOS device. Touch and hold or navigate a settings or use the app store or app cannot be deleted. Touch, and hold. Correct. Yeah, that's like android. Like that's pretty much, right?

Under which section the settings generator user. Be able to update the name. That is device. The name of the device. I would say under the about, correct. Come on guys, that's easy. I'm just gonna semias apps. Allow users to purchase additional features. What is noted next to the get button?

In-app purchases. Addition features. Yeah it literally, they're called in-app purchases, right? These are pretty easy, actually. This is well, yeah, this is not even on jam flow. This is just oh, okay, that's just iPhone. Just like general information. 100 is about done pretty much. It's like an entrant to iOS also, but there's like, scripting and the terminal.

That's like, you know, it's just the apple. Okay, so that's the second one is more macOS. Let's go backwards and then it'll have jam stuff too. Like, it'll have to have to push it update. When i have a user can opt out of sending app analysis, crash it add development be doing is set up assistant true.

I think they want to respect your privacy section to macOS core property list. Oh, i just read about that this morning playlists. It use which file extension p-list. That's it. See actually it's more in the advanced like custom configuration policy but you have a back, you know? No, no i actually did what that in a video today.

I actually, you know, i barely use the smack to be on. Trust me, i like like most of the week. I'm using my, my windows, which commands can be used to reveal the contents of the macOS directory in the command line interface. Contents of a directory. Yeah. LSU right.

Cd, it's it's the navigate and make directory is to create a new folder. Cp is to copy. Copy. Okay. Yeah, ls is the list, which is yeah, which is the right, right? Answer. Which character represents the current user's home directory in the command line interface, Or the the tell?

No, i don't tell Dar eslash the current Fluency, i believe it's, it's Ah, that's a good one. Either a or c, probably c, right? See Internet can actually require to set up a Mac false. No false, right? There's a little. What's up falls? So you said to set up a mark not to And roll it into mobile into jam, right?

So to set up, you don't have to have Wi-Fi, right? You don't have to have And no. Or is it true switch back to the answers? Let's just confirm. Yeah, that's a good one. Three. Inapper penis. I told you, okay? And three is is a slash quickly. No. Oh yeah.

Get the fourth one. Let's see if possible. Yeah. False foreign action? Yeah. Because it's not autopilot, it's just set it up like just like BYUD, right? Which is the following is content in a macOS Apple menu. Finder. Apple made like this apple menu right here. This is the apple menu shift.

Command option, space, command space. What the no, no. That's your skip. The question about it. No, i'm looking at the question. I'm just looking at my menu here for reference. So that's not spoiley's. Ball is when you search for stuff, the system preference. Oh. Sorry sorry. Sorry. My bad apple menu finder system preferences.

Yeah. So yeah, assist it's called now system settings, actually. They they changed the name, so assistant preference now was called systems, but that is the right answer. Just all right, it is It's b is b. Okay yeah. B system preferences. In order or not sorry, which keyboard shortcut can be used to access spotlight?

Um, i know it's command space. Yeah, right there spotlight search which is like the search, right? So, command space bar. So, just an fyi guys in handy, you probably know this but Command is like this little sign right here in the middle. It looks like a, like a little x.

Yeah, so comment. Yeah. Like so this this one right here In mac. This is the command and it's the equivalent of control and windows. On a window keyboard. That's like like when you do control c. That in, in Mac, it's commency. Control ctrl v, right? Yeah, they just want it kind of give you guys a So, command space bar is, is what opens?

Spotlights are tried them. It patrol. And Control space in order for a Mac OS app to run and pass Apple gatekeeper settings. It must be, i don't know what that what applicate keeper honest is, it must be submitted to apple for notarization. True all apps on the app store and seeing for macOS, do you have to send in your app and it has to be approved to be listed as an absolute?

Notarization of the term that they use for that shoe. It's fine. Right? Like that's in signing. Yeah, it's like signing signing up or is that it's like verified, right or signed, right? Yeah, yeah. Chemicals, which can be used to quickly search the web. I would say spotlight. Yeah, okay.

Yeah. Like this guy spotlight right here. You can search. It's the same thing. Like if we say if we say winnipeg city, Yeah, same thing. Like, when you hit the windows key and you can look locally for look at that. What a big city, right? It brought it from here.

You know, similar to start menu and windows one but in it doesn't okay, no, no you can search the web from start menu windows so it's not the fastest way i have to switch web. Okay. Kind of. You know, i mean? Yeah, which character is used to instruct. Oh, command line, interpret.

Ignore a line in a script. To ignore. I think it's #Let's check.

Yeah it's beat. So it's like commenting anytime. You want to like a general coding skills tells us commenting is hashtag. Yeah. So you want to comment or ignore? It's always a hashtag. Which two items cannot be removed from the dock. You guys know this is this thing at the bottom here.

It's called the dock. This, this whole thing. That's called the dock and Mac. So just kind of a net flat. Which two items cannot be able to see what, i don't know, anything which which two items, it cannot be removed from the dock. Yeah, fine. Like i can. If i right click on finder, I can hide it but i can't remove it, okay?

And the trash. Okay. Like i can hide the entire dock, right? But i can't remove these two from the dock, okay, you see. So, for example, like this vf score, it's a custom third party. I can right click and i can say Remove from dock, right? Okay, but but this trash icon.

I can't remove it. It's always paint there, right? Like i can hide the entire dog foreign but you know, more than what You know, the first one. So The command line in CLI which command, which command can be used to display manual page for other commands help. Amen. Oh man, sorry man.

Right. Yeah, i think man. Yeah, yeah.

Man, it is yeah, man. Yeah it's actually. Let's do this. Let's do that quick guys. So in in Mac it's called terminal like the CLI is called terminal. And if i type in, man, Date, what manual do you want? So yeah, that is the right command. Yeah. That's cool.

All right, which menu in macOS menu. Bar contains commonly used tasks like copy and paste. File menu or no edit menu, sorry edit. Yeah. Edit copy based, right? Right. Uh which been in the macOS menu edit menu at the top right? Yeah where can info on mac? Version processor.

Time computers. Here. Number be found. And about this Mac. Overview. So that would guess. Yeah, correct. Yeah, so if i go about the smack, Right there. More info.

This one, right? The overview. All right. No. Yes, it's right. It's not like called, yeah, it's the overview. Yeah, it's not called overview right there. All right. Next one is. Um, System settings for location services analytics and screen time can be reconfigured in system preferences. After completing setup, assistant, true or false?

After completing setup assistant. True. I did see it earlier. Yeah. True. Which macOS features. Navigate files file system. Yeah, finder finder in. Apple is like explorer in windows. Explorer that's like the windows one terminal. Is not so yeah. No find. No, no start menu. Is this guy spotlight search?

Right right finder is okay yes. Finder is like the explorer find finder in apple is exploring windows. Jaf pro. Okay? Now, jam specific along with computers devices. What is the third tab of the top left of the jam pro? I'm gonna say users. Users. Yeah, but i is now i have not gotten this far material.

It is users? Yeah, you're right. Okay. Uh what can be created within abm and asm to allow user-based and book app and book deployment realized shared iPad. What can be created within ABM to allow user-based app? Managed Apple IDs. Yeah, that's definitely. That's right. A good one manage. The Apple ID is your right sir.

By default user initiated enrollment is enabled for computers. By default user initial enrollment is enabled for buy true. Okay. Well yeah. User. True. I would say true. False. Well, i I knew it. Told you, you know, more than what you think which jam pro user account privilege set. Privilege said like permissions will grant permissions to create read ad update and delete content.

Well that's like the whole, the whole list of things, right? Like i would say administrator It's like you can do everything one mode, right? Yeah. So that would be. That's got to be an administrator. Yeah.

Yeah, administrator. Yeah, because it can do pretty much everything right? Mdm allows orcs to wirelessly. Configure update and deploy content. True. Of course. Yeah. Of course. I mean that's the whole point, right? A push cert is required to physically communication between apple. Push apn and mobile device management. Absolutely 100% true.

You always insert. This is like Like common. What is the name of the payload within a computer pre-station enrollment that determines what type of user accounts create during setup assistant. The name of the payload. Configuration program. Yeah. A computer enrollment, that turns the type of user accounts created during setup system.

I would say config profiles. Let's see.

Account settings. Ah, you know what? Uh, yeah, yeah. That makes sense account settings. Sure. Okay. So, configuration profiles guys in jam. It's also called configuration Pro as an intune, but it's the equivalent in microsoft land is group policies. So it's it's like it's for example, enabling bitlocker on the device.

No, because the configuration profiling both japanese intune. But we call groupals in ad, right? An active directory. Right account settings, i guess that that was a pre-stage moment. Jeff Pro custom messaging and digitalized agreements can be added to the user initiated enrollment screens, true or false. Yes. I would say true.

I would say true. Yeah, yeah, true. There you go. So we can add custom messaging. Computers can receive remote commands, config profiles, which will receive like group policy. Essentially, in microsoft plan, app deployment is just like chrome, Firefox, blah, blah Jemfro. If they are unable to communicate with apn, I think that's true.

I don't think apn is a requirement for us to deploy to push an app. You know, i would say true. Oh false. What that? What that are limited. So i can't so so jam. So, basically what this is saying, i'm sorry, this RMM cannot work me. No is the same.

Jeff is useless. If the device, i don't connect the apn. That's what that's saying, right? You think? Mm is useless, right? If i can't if the device and design able to communicate with the apn, right? Apn is um, Push notification service. Right there app, a port notification service. It's it's like when you get a push notification on your on your iOS at home or Mac.

That service is what pushes the notifications. So pretty, what the what this number nine. Question number nine saying is they're saying Gems is useless. If the device is unable to connect with ABN, if you can't basically can't do anything with jap. Even if the devices enrolled with jam, it's useful.

It might be able to give you some information with the device, so it's not quite useless. No, no, what they're saying. I'm not sure. It's not able to execute commands. Yeah, i can't do it once. It's computers can receive. And receive mirror stand, receiving one of the False. There are.

Oh, i see, i'm an idiot, false right? The answer is false, right? Community computers cannot receive. Me, that's what i'm saying. Janfro is useless. If they, if you can compute with AP and you see You know. So meaning, meaning for jam pro to be useful, the device has to communicate with APN.

You know number 10 which i guess you wait for Henry. Maybe we can take this one which section will jump from might show important information about the state and gem pro server. Such as push certificate is expiring soon. Uh, I would say. Warnings. I, i don't know, i guess i can't.

Your heart notifications. Okay. Hi, they should be wait for Henry. Yeah, you'll be wait for Henry for a month. Maybe we've gone through. Three of the sections. They don't seem too bad. Really? No. I that's like i don't know anything about opportunity and i am able to 90 percent of it.

Like yeah 89%, right? Yeah. I think junk is, is look, 100 is really, like, really? Like like sales? I think like say like it's like four, four and a c133, right? Yes, you don't really yeah. Two hours like low effort. Like just yeah, just very oh best. Yeah. Actually they changed it now.

They They just have like one course with foreign. Yeah, instead of NSC, one to three, it's just like, one overview like sales. Yeah, it's kind of like a solid course. And then they have like an NSC and then you jump to nc4. Holy smokes. It's actually, they switched it.

They don't have the, i think they're called something else now, but they have, Like there's three variations of what used to be NSC for. So there's like more specific ones oh like three different ones you can do. So it should be easier than getting an ac4. I see. But you can just like, with this more specific, so it's more broken down.

Yeah, i see. Oh, interesting. Is it still? Like, you go all the way up to nc8? Yeah, i think their naming of a chain slightly. But yeah, then inciated is like the. I think there's only like kind of that roadmapled fuel. It's like very few people have that With, with jamster.

The highest is jam 400. Yeah, so, if you are jam 400, like you're, you're like a, an expert level macOS wizard. I know this is all easy for you, Hannah. I'm just kidding. We bought wine henry with. It's like, what is this guy's going? I'm just kidding. Section 4 device management.

Uh, simple device inventory, search results can be exported jamp pro and the volume format. Mmm, that's a good one. I would say device inventory, search results. I would say, i would say d. I feel like, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry. Replacement research results. Next one, i would say I would say dessorial cd.

I don't know, d is the closest thing to what i also be used. Tsv XML t sv. I don't know what tsv is. I know what csv and XML are but i don't know what dsv is. Static device. Group membership is variable and updates automatically based on device eligibility.

But usb is like csv button mark. Oh top separated values. Types of pre. I like that. That's one serious comma. Separated. This is daps, right? Yeah, but that's that's a good. Good one. Don't caught me on the market side of things. It might be also in windows, is it.

So actually, the next question, i came across it this morning as well. Static device group, memberships. Started your life. So So you guys, you know, in microsoft in intra it's called dynamic groups. And Jeff, it's called smart groups. And so smart group standards, they dynamically update the membership of the group like they add users or devices to the group in and out of the group based on criteria is on a syntax.

It's not, you're not you don't statically, that's just static. Device is the opposite of smart groups as the opposite of dynamic groups. And so the answer for that question is false. Because it's saying static groups update automatically. And that's false. They don't update automatically, right? That's what a smart group does not a static group, right?

The question, three in an advanced mobile device search. Which operator can be used to find all matches contain? The specified valve, not exact. And advanced search, which operative is defined all matches. Uh, see like Because you say like this, find all matches and that's exactly what Yeah, like we use even that we we use that even in sql like queries and search like the like command.

Or operator, i guess, you know. Uh, creating separate mobile device config profiles like, you know, like mobile device, i guess. Equal equivalent of group policies is preferred over. Bundling many payloads into a single, config profile. It's a Creating separate mobile device config is prefer. Over bundling many payloads into sync effect before i see that true i didn't.

That's this number four is the best practice in any empty. I'm not just a couple mobile device. So break them down into separate profiles, instead of a one Profile. That, you know, why? Why is that? What can anybody tell me? Why? Number four is the best practice is preferred.

It's easier to report on. It's successful or unsuccessful, right? You know. The following character can be used. Oh sorry, i'm looking at the answer sheet. The fact you can be used as a wild card and a simple mode device search. D d, right? Yeah, these are great. I mean it's wild card right?

Like it's telling you it's the following can be used as a wild card. It is a wild card. Which anniversarys are available for email reporting. Advanced mobile device search. Wow, guys, this is really powerful. You can send a weekly or report for device. Social homework from Jeff, that's pretty powerfully.

You know. I would say. I would say b. Be. Yeah. There you That makes perfect sense. Where can jam admin go to changed, inventory attribute system and complaining a simple mobile device, search Where a jacket go to change. The inventory attributes listed. And a simple structure. Change the inventory, attributes.

Again.

Yeah, that's B, you're right. Settings version of inventory display. Yeah. Number eight, advanced mobile device. Search can only report on managed devices

Probably reports. What is that? If the device is not managed by jacket, wouldn't be even Get a room. Wouldn't even be in jab to begin with. But i would say true on that. False. Also, i can even report on unmanaged devices too. First. So all we considered an unmanaged device than in this case.

Oh like a BYOD. But how would it know about it? From from the logs, maybe. Yeah. Okay, so, i guess advanced mobile search can also go into the logs and report on unmanaged devices like BYOD. Okay, so it can report both on company owned and personally owned, okay? That makes sense.

Number nine, a device config profile which is like a group policy was created and saved without a target scope. Which device will received this config profile. The device convert was created and saved without the scope. I would say b. I think so. You know what device? It's like saying you didn't scope the profile to anything, which devices will receive it.

No devices. I would say, so, Yeah no devices because he didn't scope it. Like that's that's like literally there. An app store. App installed by jam can be updated automatically. We literally asked that question yesterday, right? I said true, right. Yeah, true. And so that's part of app app, lifecycle app life.

App life cycle. Workflow the remote command available for mobile device, very depending on ownership type the company owned versus personally owned right? Device model OS version and supervision status. Remote commands available. Very depending on ownership type device model os version and supervision status true. Now, there you go. True.

All right, section five computer, man. We're almost at the innovator. Computer config profiles like which is like group policies, can be used to enforce local user account password compliance. I would say true. But see this is talking about compliance memory.

I would say true, eh. Although i just don't like the use of the word compliance in here, but sure. True. Yeah. Because when i think about compliance, i think about measuring not about changing. Issuing a law computer remote command will log out the user. Law computer restart the computer and set a firmware level passcode that will need to be entered before the computer can be used again.

All these smokes I'd say that false. True, only smokes. So guys, make sure you don't click that one. Okay. Because that I thought that was like, i don't know. Someone I don't i mean i guess just locking the computer. Yeah. It's like, would that be? Yeah. But that's like even more intrusive than that, right?

I think that's luck. Firmer level passcode. Holy smokes. Because why would you need to just lock it at the screen if it's just there. Yeah. Laptop in a Starbucks or something like yeah. Yeah. Yeah, makes it like lock like really lock the phone can be configured to remove a specific computer building or department from the scope of a config profile.

Exclusion presentation to remove this, remove a specific computer building or department from the scope. I would say exclusion. Yeah, since he It's Exclusions like filters and internet. I guess by exclude. Can fake profiles? Me only be created in jamf Pro. True, or false? True, you said, even me, of course, that's true.

Right. Like False. But, okay, but what does that mean? Department can finish profile is a group policy. Oh, there are local group policy there. Oh, right. I can create a configuration profile within the macOS locally? Oh i see. Yeah, it's like local. All right, right? It's like local group policies, right?

Right. It's like i can just reward into the device and do a config profile from there, right? To troubleshoot computer config so they're called like even locally like i guess if i search my My here.

I guess, i mean, you can I can create. Yeah, right there. Uh, trevor. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah.

Or no profiles if i do this. Yeah. Like i guess you could create them from here. Hey henry probably, you know about this or A local configuration profile. You can create them here, right? Myself but yeah probably yeah because obviously it says false. So obviously you can do them locally the troubleshoot a computer can fake profile and admission should verify the payloads or configure appropriate and review which area and jam for additional info.

Is someone here? I've heard a toilet plush like maybe 10 times. That is like always like that. Yeah, flushes those automatic. There's one watch for my bat sensor. I think has bad sensor or something. Yeah. Like it's always like that. The water goes down. Yeah, we should maybe we should let heavier know about it.

Have here is a building management. You know, i just love them. I thought about telling him just, just, send an email subject. Scary water flush. It took me a while halloween thing. What's the time first? You weeks in the building, Like in late hours and i say, yeah, somebody's here.

Not so config. Professing will be created troubleshoot. So it's a actually you guys, sorry. The troubleshoot computer config prof has an admin. Should verify the pales have completed appropriate and review which air in general information logs. Logs, the first thing you should look at the logs. It's considered a good practice to avoid bundling, multiple non-related payloads into a single computer configured pressure for true.

We actually just saw a similar question to that before, right? So, So, that is true. Seven and a computer policy. What determines when the policy will run? I would say a trigger. Yeah, it's like a scheduled task, right? Yeah, trigger, right. That's right. Very similar terminology so that's good scripts and software can be deployed with a policy.

That true. I would have said that's false really script and soccer because to me coming as an into an admin, i think of a policy as a configuration profile. It's not something that you could deploy. You deploy. An app or software with. I would deploy i 132, and into for an app.

No, that is true. So a policy is is just a change on a device, it's not an app but let's actually see Scripts themselves can be part with the policy. True. Wow, henry, you're good. Your good brother. All right. MacOS app store apps cannot be made available for a user download.

Self-service using genfro. That was apps to relax. I would say false app store for Service how you made available for a user to download and sell service? Using example cannot. Yeah, that's true. I would say false. I don't think they can, they can go to the app store and that point absolutely.

When no such a jump management, they cannot go to the app store on their own. That i think they can't. But you can do it like a per app level, right? And you can still, you can. So if you have an iphone or something, or even a Mac, they come with pre-installed, absolutely can choose which to include and wish not to include but this is specifically for the app store.

So can you do it on a perab basis or a strict certain ones? Like i'm not sure actually I thought went into the box is jammed enrolled. That when you go to the app store you will not be able to do like basically let's see. Yeah i haven't studied this but Okay, exposure.

So the user even with champ enrolled user can still go to their app store. And you can and you can make certain apps available for self-service, okay? Yeah, i cannot be made just like an interview just like company portal. Makes sense company portal, right? Yeah. Just like an internet, i guess.

Computer config profiles, which is like our And policies can be scoped to categories. Yes.

Like what? What does beauty mean by a category? A category. I think i think that might be a false. We'll see. False. For it. Category. Just category would be just like like say say, you can see these bunch of devices are categorized as Marketing or sales or finance. You know like it's a cat.

It'll be why ord? It's a category. It's not a group. Scope, add some pulses to groups, but not to categories. You see?

So, let's see here. Okay, so next, sorry guys, we're almost there. Eh. If a macros app store app scope to minneapolis minneapolis building, an IT department who will receive the app. Come on guys. Everyone in the monopolist building and everyone in the IT department. Right, that's obvious. No a Yeah.

Hey Yeah, it's kind of like the basics. You can tell these guys from minneapolis, i'm just kidding. Macro is app store. App updates can be forced if the app Meant is managed. MacOS app store, app updates can be forced. If the app is managed, i would say, that's true.

True. Yeah. And if a japdroid men wanted to create a computer group, when the membership update automatically, what type of group should be created Dynamic automatically, that should be dynamically. No smart. Remember, in jam, it's called smart an entry. It's called dynamic.

I don't know, they just decided to call it smart, smart groups or smart, computer group membership. Policy status can be monitored from the jamf. Pro dashboard, i would say true.

Under a computer policy, execution frequency, which is not an option. Holy. Or actually. Once per computer, once every day,

Yeah, once we're computer number C or i guess c, Yeah, once per year maybe doesn't make why would you want to update for you but what's once per computer? Yeah, once per year whatever i guess makes sense. Not across the second part when playing a config profile, which is Policy or app, see the differentiate between a config profilement and a policy.

I mean, in jazz, the differentiate these two, these are two different terms. Whereas an internet, config profile is really a policy, it's just interchangeable and into it. But in jam it. Config profile is not the same as a policy. Us can be provide different and gems. Yeah. But an intune we got Config provides the which is really just changeably called policies and apps.

That's it. Which type defines who will receive the management task. Which, Tab. Okay scope. Yeah, he thinks go Scopies. All right, that's it guys. So he's not going to help are real loud. Can we get the exam you guys? Thank you. Well, we went back altogether. So maybe if you guys want to challenge.

That exam on your own and we've done jam f and we can ask for more codes if we fail. I don't know. You guys want to do that. I still want collectively. Now, one day one collectively sure. No yes. I mean that's against as long as they don't turn on the camera In a room.

Yeah, that's true. No no. There's no cameras. You know. All record Probably not in jail. I don't think that. Come on. This is gents 100 just to get access. The first this is just for the company. Should we do it all together or should? I think we should do the higher level ones like that jamf 200 in visually maybe.

Okay. But this one, i mean, this is just to get access to the portal. Right? We just need access to the jam portal. Like we don't need, they said you don't need the requirement anymore. I don't need to be certified shit, right? Shop 100. But you need a minimum jeff-100 rate to get access to the portal.

No, i thought it's not a requirement. I thought that they said during the meeting that is no longer. I, i think that was it. It's 200 is no longer requirement. It was 100

No, i just need access to the portal. We just need to access the portal. That will give us the portal. You think how? So i thought you said the the portal is locked behind the jam 100. It's locked behind this. Like can i can i access the jam portal right now?

Without taking this, you'll have to let them, we'll have to show we have, but this is the minimum requirement to access the jam portal, right? You're right. So let's do autonomously. Like everybody had like we have to let them know abdullah. Did it, right? Oh, oh, i see. We could do it this way if we don't have a generic company account like, oh, yes, i guess if there isn't like christmas in being a quiet woman.

What? Not sure. I'm maybe cheating. But so shouldn't i mean, okay. I should. We do it now individual. I don't have my laptop here, but Well, what do you guys think? I mean, should we do it now? I can learn you later if you guys agree. I mean also, i see what you're saying.

So i sing abdullah can access the portal, if he passed the gem 400, i don't know. This is very technical. All right. I think she's just me. You need to pass individuals to do it to get access to make sense. Yeah. Yeah. She said the partnership cannot be established.

Until it's one person gets young, at least one. For the partnership. Once partnership, which also means the portal So even if you haven't done it, yeah, but they need, but before dealership can be established. Between our company and then yeah, on a partners, at least one person, they need to have the commitment.

We have to commit to the $200. Minimum minimums. Yeah. After weight period and the jaff-100 and the gentleman. Let's do it. Okay. Oh purchase. Oh, when i for a hundred dollars, i have a coupon. It's like, oh good. What? What is this house? I i i mean i'm gonna take it in Mandar, No, no, this is catching.

It's meandering is the one before. Oh, sorry.

It's funny. That's about to ask me. How did you know? It's like obviously you didn't, right? How did you know? I should have fluid it a little bit. You guys are smart. Yeah, no, actually this one is mattered. It's Chinese. No, no. That one is japanese. Look at that.

That one is okay. It's japanese. So you want to take the japanese? I think the chinese, maybe. Well, give the handy? The dutch? Yeah. Español.

It's real speaks but i don't know why. I thought you had the

Oh look at that. Oh look at that. We're just called Jeff tomorrow. A Monday morning five hour guys. Pass it in five different languages. I guess you might have some Spanish because i remember you in the states, right? Or both. The only thing i don't know. You probably didn't speak, no, but maybe you speak a bit of i guess so much 75.

Is that after 75% is the past right? Okay, it's a pass mark. Okay. I think that's you. I think we got 75. Maybe. Yeah. So oh there's a wise time. Why is used for neck remaining time to each? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, okay right now all of us. Just give it a run.

I don't a pass, or don't you or collectively? Each. I can't. Well, what's the benefit of us all doing it? The partnership and the and the portal, uh, well saying that and also get access to support just one person i believe. Yeah. But if we so we can start.

So we can start managing our own apple devices like the the ones we bought, right like that this one and then for up house, i guess. Like just to have that, you know, it's just an extraction. We definitely needed for uphouse right? Like, you know so but i guess what is a fireplace?

It's Trevor's like, oh, it's good. If we all happened to pass right now, it might be better. And if we don't necessarily know the material, Very well then then we haven't accomplished much. Just we got like another piece of certificate that Yeah, like should each go through the learning material on their own?

No. But if that's the practice exam, Okay. Well right. What else do you want to learn? Yeah like what i mean but the exam is most likely going to be far more difficult than the practices now and they can't. Use those same questions twice and those were very basic.

You never know. So, It would be more beneficial to do it together because probably At least half of us, 45 days to complete the exam. Okay, can you retry it? After purchase, right? Like if you pay for it. Oh okay. There's 16. Yeah, 60. Multiple choice and the different, you know, where to find stuff, where to click on things?

Yeah, yeah, it's probably not about it. You have to But maybe just like It doesn't seem to be too complicated. Let's get each a week and let's show it to get the exam. Now what you guys, i like that. Okay, yeah, maybe let's just each go through. So what should you do doing that week?

Just go through just go through letting material maybe. Like, i don't know, there were some okay like no what is uh Configuration profile. For example, if you're not from, i'm not familiar with that. I know it's similar to intune but okay, what is it? Like, what is included in there.

So go understand these concepts. Maybe it's like how we make a change on the computer. Right, that's what fiction profiles, but i'm now intrigued to know, actually, what's the difference in convention profile and a policy? Sure that is interesting. What do you like to learn more about? Yeah, like let me skip through the boring stuff, right?

Maybe some boring stuff about apple get to the meat quick. Time yourself time is money team, you know, like don't make it like i like what about i mentioned earlier about how sometimes before he watches the youtube video. He would summarize some very quickly because really he doesn't have creative, i don't have time for.

Yeah, really. I really don't right to watch all of this, right? This video is gonna answer his curiosity or, or is it gonna just waste his time so you Uh, so maybe we're worth, pushing yourself time yourself. Anything you're back, the weak runs out. Just challenge yourself, let's take exam i think about like up house.

So we approached them. They are seriously interested in and managed services that they do want to get us. Yeah, a contract on message. So so be a very good incentive for us to learn this and and we let them know. And if we if we win the contract, with my up house, we will Be able to.

We'll have the opportunity manage at least 40 plus devices, right with jam, right? And by the way, just wanted to let you guys know there are Jeff is not the only apple centric mdm solution out there but it's the rose rise of the of the apple mdm. So we're picking the best of the best of apple.

Mm. Like, by the way we could have gone with into inforaging apple devices because internet's cross platform it can, but it's not as good as Jeff. Right. Jeff is like that the, the the, the, the flagship, I mean. Yeah. Probably like certain apples specific stuff that like you can't get from in too much certain map pretty much so.

So just why it's kind of reassuring to know. Just we're going with really the bit. It's by the way, what one of the most it's probably not the right. It's it is the most expensive mbn. Uh for apple. They mentioned that training course was like 3500 something like what?

For the for like that or the course? Yeah. Yeah it is the most expensive apple and yeah, but it's the best for sure. And 400 it's like four thousand something. I think there was one 20 something. And by the way, have you guys heard of g and you see Jay sorry.

J in u, c. Jazz nation user conference. Okay, this guy's got a conference. It's like opening. Let's see. When is it? Yeah, yeah. Last year event. Let's see the videos. It's happening. Nash valley? Yeah, and then we'll go to Vegas with that. Oh, Right. Natural. Okay, i think that shirts and they got things like that.

Okay, well, maybe keep everybody the way i knew about this is from youtube, right? Because i was just looking up how to do apple, like, how you do app app patching, okay, with jam. And then a video, like a long format game from jnu. Jay knock, i guess, cool.

But these guys got a conference where they bring in like, like expert level. Like jam 400, right? Like the highest the best people in jamf and Yeah. Something cool. Let's see. So we have a little bit of time left here. So we're going with the best at the best, a few other things.

But let's see if travel 100, you would like to cover something or maybe. Uh, Take the mice. Perhaps we're on a podcast room. What what? I really would like to find find about. Okay, is that can i block access to outlook? If a company owned devices, not managed by jamf.

I want to immediately. Block access to outlook and teams on a company owned Mac. If it's not managed by gen, Company owned mark if it's done. So so see this is this is a house on, right? So it's registered an ABM. Yeah, no, no. Not abm gem, that's it.

Okay, so so user on a company owned, Mac, they're sitting there. They go try to go out outlook. Oh they got a sticky. Pop a reminder pop up in in the screen, says sorry. Your device's in compliant. Contact your IT. They can't actually comment, obviously, five resources, like company, like outlook and teams.

If the device is not managed by general, It's not MDM managed. That's i'd like to find out if that as possible. What would be a case for that. Similar to how an intune i say, if the device can run not enrolled in Intune, I'd like to feed that as a signal and conditional access and block access to output and themes.

What will be use case? Because that's what our house wants, right? They want all the devices to be managed by gem. So in my concern would use the apple mail, i mean, but my concern will FA user have local admin on their device. Either mistakenly or maliciously, something might pull the device out of jam.

If the device account is not enrolled a company on device, not enrolled in jam, Would you not? Would you would you not agree that it's not an insecure state? Like it's not. I can't push updates, i can't push apps and profiles to it, right? Yeah it is. I'm exactly.

I want to block access to outlook and teams if it's in compliant. Yeah, i want something to measure. Like, i just got on target off target. It's not in jam. Block. Access to outlooking teams. Not sure. Yeah, not sure. But not just, i would like to find out if that is possible, okay?

If you guys come across this like, is that possible to feed a gem Compliance signal into conditional access, which is an intra, right in and and say, required of us would be marked as compliant. And what does that mean? The minimum bar is to be Uh, enrolled in gem in mobile device management.

That would be cool. I don't into this possible to do that specifically of jam can incorporate with. And with conditional access conditional access exactly. Okay, yeah. Cooperate to feed that it defeat a signal into it within jamb. Shouldn't there be something that you can restrict app access restrict like access to outlooking teams.

If it's not a role in jeff, Okay, but how would jamf know about the device? It's not even enroll in the first place, right? So yeah. So yeah. It's kind of thought about this, right? So, I was kind of curious. I mean to to see It'll be. That's an interesting question.

Hold no. To see how they collaborate both collaborate. Yeah. Like, but that's such an important thing to have though. Yeah, i agree. Like you don't want to be chasing people or say, hey, can i Kind of check if your computer is enrolled in gem for not Right. Apparently, you can integrate jam.

Pro microsoft engine. Oh and then from Intune, you get a compliance and then you pass it jam. Will this continue conditional access support in a future release of jam, pro removal date first, whatever 2024 that sounds anti-pattern like we should actually continue supporting not discontinuing. Yeah, i don't know.

Yeah. Due to the migration away from microsoft's partner device management fine. But what is the alternative though? Do they are they giving out an alternative like you have a document for it. Let's see if you can share that on on teams of slack now. Yeah, that's interesting.

I mean, we don't want to be disruptive to the to the business workflow, but it makes perfect sense for a company owned macOS. Mac. Mac device. Tab now offers an alternative solution called macOS device compliance using Microsoft's new partner, complied management API. Nice. So, I'll send you the By the way.

Believe it or not, guys. I just asked that questioning. This morning. I at I, i asked that question this morning, so let's see if i i was kind of Like, Oh look, i got 18 responses. I got that. Like asked that question. Then i got 18 responses, guys. Look at that.

Oh, that's for patching. Sorry. But i also got sorry, i got another one here. Oh, there you go. Yeah. Is it possible to block access i just posted six hours ago? And people are saying. Look at the geph into an integration. Then, when you're talking about, Say, five hours ago, you don't have to manage into the mdms.

So i thought, i thought they're discontinuing, or are they not discontinuing it, or it's going to be and then they have a Try not to manage. Into emblem. What they said.

So, there you go. So it is possible. The answer for that. Question is, yes, i ask that question Trevor in six hours ago. And i got, I got uh, i got five responses to that. 728 people viewed my profile. I'm such an influencer, guys, you know, i'm going to be, i'm going to be like uh A couple years from today.

I'm going to be like not even a millionaire like me and i'm gonna be billionaires. I'm just kidding. And Trevor and Harry, we'll take, we'll take Trevor on henry with us to be to become true. Now i'm just saying that's the way to do it is through reddit marriage, you know, that's funny.

It asks, the ask one guy one time. They're like, we need like, well, how did you become a millionaire? He was like, oh, i was a billionaire that i got married. You need to set up Jeff compliance as so. Look at that guys like the power of reddit like six hours ago.

I asked the question on a saturday Six hours later. I got five expert. Level, you know, answers to my to my stupid questions or mentioned that jam in tune integration. Look at this guy, he has jumped 300 Okay. Yeah. But the top comment. Look at the jack into an What set a bunch of nerds?

Yeah. Oh, that's great though. Foreign and conditional access to work Japanese to trigger a80 requires a gems binary. Okay, too long. Don't read depends if you guys were under it but when we were in college, all of my classmates were unreaded And i'll have time. They would put the assignments on read it and they'll collaborate with others people.

Just on the assignments when they are. Why not right? Like me. ACE electronic circuits. Rc you would see like a lots of reddit is a great place to be on, then they have fiber now so they want you to pay them fiver. Oh fiber, yeah, that's people. Yeah, i we actually moving or not our IVR message, Thank you for content again.

It's from somebody on five, jack blast comprise really good person there after Fiber is a good platform. Great. Well, so there you go. Apparently, we can feed that signal in conditional access a right there. By setting up Jeff compliance as compliance part on an intern. So you're not enrolling.

I just pulled out all these little things. And now, in the forms in there, i can't actually click into the buttons on this, the volume of the power.

He's adding three more computers to. One of the Martindale's. Okay, he's he wants them like right now, this guy dalbert is one of the most Interested guys like businessmen that i've ever worked like even my more like you pull his hair out, i was like what? Like he tells you something and then like five minutes later and just do the complete office or just like it's just um probably you know.

You need to hire a professional psychologist to understand how this guy thinks, like you didn't speak to. He hired this guy, his vice president agent and he's like golfer but times of thousand like on It was crazy. I couldn't sit down and have a conversation. They haven't, they haven't.

Yeah, exactly. If you have a character, like, if you're trying to Ask him. Okay, well, have tried to restart your iphone. Go ahead. Yeah. It doesn't even want to spend like five seconds. I'll give you something information to help him, right? Like, just And well, no, he had this guy named AJ now gone and not go back again, right there, maybe four months.

I don't think he worked a day though. It's like i set him up and then he was calling me three months later asking me what his password was and he never signed in or something. And then he was when i when i started helping him, he had like two phones and then he called his dad and he was swearing it at dad or phones that gets a nice patio for furniture who and he's just all over the place.

Like a like a Is consciousness was just like a stream and it was like one thing would be after everywhere. Just really, man, i just these guys. I just people, i mean honestly this client like we've We probably spend more time with. Like they, they cost us more than what we actually charge them.

You know what i mean? Like, stumbling rules. Like cost, not just like, you know, like like financially just like Like, you know, you like energy wise, you know, there's so much energy from you, you know? Like more than what you actually, what we actually charge them. You're not just okay.

I've had like dreams. It's seriously, like nightmares. Like something is clients like, just knowing that next morning, i have to deal with this person. It's sometimes, you know, but you know like, you know, workers work business business. But this client this specific like well, Sometimes you just have to mark, actually.

You just need multiple different people to deal with them. I just like, uh, yeah. Like with these mad at someone, we've got a cycle in mom. If he's madam, mom would cycle me and put Trevor in every once in a while. Yeah. Like, you know, just once in a while just deal with this person like and then the difference with like up house, it's like night and day.

It's like just. Oh yeah. Oh up house is like them. What the best client? I want to i want more of that, right? Like, every like like Kirsten you would like sit with me. It's like Do this. Sign me up. Yeah. They're just like open to change. She's like she was thinking about it.

Yeah, i mean that's like see all the thing about. Yeah, yeah. That's that's a good suggestion but we're thinking yes there's no compression a lot between FGC and up house. There's sitting at all, it's like day and night started and until now a lot of time when i tell him what's something, he would say something.

Are on it. Bite you by bite you in the ass right? Like sorry. Yeah. Yeah. But a lot of time it was approval like a lot but prove approved. When did you even read my email to prove it like when did he even get a chance to read them but i you're fine.

It's true. Talking about, right? What do you have an Automated that improved and they are. We? We want to reward that that good customer, you know, we want to Keep it up, keep up our good work so it really stays that way. Anyway and even improves. Absolutely. Uh you know, it's the last thing i want to see things shifting with up house.

So So if you guys have any feedback or while through the process seeing issues, Let us like, you know, let me know, let us know how we can do things better for them because Honestly, i want to reward that relationship and i want to make sure it is great.

Relationship house is great in that, that would help the people our scalable, right? Like building connections that, you know, or like Both like we're you know, it's just mutually respectful. It's like having a customer like FTC like it's hard to build on right now. I don't know where their head is at.

And yeah, they're like every five minutes house their customers like every one of their customers could be a potential customer of hours two and they are opening their bridges already. Introducing us to this and this and this. Yeah, we're doing work. So it's You know what sooner or later guys you'll you'll see it.

We'll probably use their services to help us in marketing and sales. That was yeah. Like i'm really thinking of But you know, i want to slow that like i don't mix the relationship so much just You know, to keep things under Control. But i really want to reach out one day to them and seek it their advice.

How can we become a customer? How can you help us in our marketing foundation? And Baby, no, even like leading that cold calling campaign. If that's something, they that they help, because there are i think they're expert in this. Um, Yeah, up house. Certainly Do well or you can, it's a great company and organically grew.

And i'm glad to know whatever you were looking at SharePoint issue the other day. I think you called Uh, one of the users acidity. Yeah. You are a new you work. And you also with that with Jordan, and she said no issues, right? You discovered there is no issues.

The with share points. I'm glad to see that. Yeah. Uh, because i was, they were having, like, issues, just with, like latency. And i think, i feared that to you, like sharing, like links and stuff, right? It seems to be just like a little bit slower than Dropbox, but she said, it wasn't like a huge break, the break, but like hereston mentioned, i think it was like four people that had that issue.

So i spoke with one of them but then there's two other people on speaking of the next week, but But i couldn't do much because she was trying to show me the issue and it wasn't really occurring. And then she kind of just said like, yeah, it's not not really that big of a deal.

It was just curious if there's Like a workaround for it but essentially when she's generating links for like folders or files, it just takes like three or four seconds compared to drop box where it's a little bit. Quicker. But other than that, they had no issues. So, Makes sense.

Yeah. I don't really know what we can do with Oxford. Not a bunch of unfortunately, but limitation. Unless it's a computer specific issue. Yeah. I actually have a lot. Are you finding SharePoint Is there? Sinking issues? Have you tried to sync? Share one and one drive i have, i, i have one drive installed.

All right, there, actually see the icon, i have it. You computer? What if you go to a SharePoint slide? Have you tried to think? Let's just curious? Uh, yeah, let's go to office.com. Opens that site and being go to share point. Exercise. Be a share points. As you saw her where you could, probably compare the experience.

Yeah, like the problem is when she was trying to show it to me, she's like, yeah, that's not really occurring right now. What happens every once in a while business, actually. Do you have a synced site already above your SharePoint? You have already things? I know. No, not yet.

Okay. Um, A finder window. I have one drive. There's anything. Um, No. Sorry public creating a link for one of those folders that you have in your OneDrive. Like so how was i think the business? What sure. The business Hours. Allow To be honestly, i haven't tried sinking a SharePoint site on on my Mac before.

So this would be the first time. Oh, by the way, Trevor i tried before the coin vpn here and a work, it works. Yeah. Works really yeah. Actually like, it's right there actually see this one. I just wanted to show you just to see how it looks like on a Mac like it's pretty much looks like a windows.

But, And just coming up i guess. But it's like, there's like when i try to actually Launch the photo client. Is like a pop-up sign in here.

Yeah. It's just

Right their business. Okay, so maybe it's open any document about just 2020. Check that just right. Right? Click on, create a link. And you have anything in 2024. I know, i think it's new about 2023, maybe. That's 150. Mentioned like if she clicks on like sub folders. It will just be blank for like like this.

I think it was i just thinking because he just said, maybe, well, in terms were saying for quite a while so Like all of her folders really synced for, definitely, what i heard from some editors that SharePoint is lower than Dropbox for Mac. I heard some of that. Yeah, i was reading what it to you and there's something.

Okay. Then maybe, when i. But i remember we discussed that when i told you that's one of the kind of the things to keep in mind, right? If this comes up team where this issue for that house, the users repeats, that thinks a little bit slower, not terribly slow.

Unfortunately, we don't have to use. Keep rumbling about it. We'll just say, this is unfortunately. Unknown thing with microsoft SharePoint, it's like a slower. We're hoping that as more Mac users adopt the SharePoint, it will be better. And if we have ways to report this to microsoft, like, maybe on Reddit or it's slower, but it's not, but it's still works, right?

It's relation. She said, like, She was kind of mad at herself or even making a complaint because it was such a little issue. If we have waste, okay, their voice And create like a customer voice or a, or a request to Microsoft on the republic platforms. And let them know we have brought this to microsoft and share that with them and hopefully it gains more voice.

That's i think something we could do. Like i if any if this becomes more of an issue of multiple request, let's try to create like a customer voice. Uh, request on microsoft sites. Okay. And, Just take it from there. This doesn't. Yeah, sounds good. The only thing i just want to show Trevor that i i noticed.

For decline is the only app. That. Uh, oftentimes It pops up for permissions on my on my Mac. Even though i granted it full access permissions. Oh, really? But it's the only app that constantly every once in a while pops up with accessing for permissions. I'm like i already granted the app for permissions.

Relaxes like the 40 client on an apple device, actually. Like i i i've installed other apps that are also requested full access permission similar to four client but they don't pop up every once like the first time, they only popped up when the first time i installed them and that's it.

Allow them given from access done, but for the client even though i granted it full access it's still pops up every once in a while says i need full access. I'm like, what do you need for access to? I already gave it to you. So, I just wanted to kind of mention that but but when it works, it works right?

Yeah, i Connect to CCI VPN. If i hit connect, That looks slightly different. Yes, like i i really It is blank. Just, It's not that. I mean it works like what's the time? It works but now i don't know why it's not working. Honestly, it's just maybe we would jinxed it.

Yes, he like how it has that little lock icon beside it. Unlike like say excel excel doesn't have it, firefox up. CD like these ones, a chrome but this one for the client if i click on that, it just keeps like jumping. Just like waiting for me to do something.

And i'm like, what do you want me to? To do. Like, So if i go in here, if i go under Just spins up. I don't know. Four squid. I've noticed that in the like and for the past couple weeks, if i go into a system settings, if i go under Um, where is that?

Pride. Yeah, accessibility accessibility and then Know. I'm used to doing that for some here. Yeah, privacy and security. Oh accessibility, you're right. And then right there. So, For a client. No, not in here. There was another Can you just try to search for the app from within settings? Uh, like in here.

Foreign. Four client. What happens by search for keeper because i know keeper. No, not keep her like say teen viewer. Exercise. If i search for four client, i think this this this the search only searches the settings, not, not the apps. But if i add, okay, if i add four client, if i give it Permissions is given permissions.

For a client right there. See how it has that little lock beside it. I open it. So now it, i don't know why did it remove it? Or i don't know if it was there. It. I thought it was there already. Like, that's funny. I never removed that really.

Go in here, connect to CCIV. No, not this one. But like, if i connect to open for the client console,

See like it keeps jumping. On me. Like, i don't know. It's so funny like It's just so frustrating sometimes. Yeah, it's just okay. But honestly, like, i don't know. Accessibility general, it's okay. We don't want to waste much time with it now but that's fine. I think if i restart my market probably would, Would work.

Oh yeah, disc disk. Where's disc?

Yeah, like right there. I'm going to turn it off. And turn it back on a disk, axis, full disc axis, Or shut down for a client, okay? Oh, four squid is different than shut down, right?

Yeah, like Yeah, it's funny like four squid. Doesn't actually shut down the thing, right? If i try it again. It should come up in here, i think. Like, Yeah, it's so funny. It just know that i'm here. So, What, what else? And anything else we want to call her before we conclude perhaps?

Yeah, i don't know. You guys have any. What's Any questions for me, any projects i i wanted to share with you guys something. We've been me and we're working on as well. Um, Would be the we want to talk about change management, right? But maybe we'll keep that one.

Yeah, like file one, second open. Yeah, maybe speaking we're talking with Yeah, i have done this on my computer, um, but i, i can Every time with briefly disciplined, fire notification. Yeah. Well, it was basically just like setting up a scheduled tasks on like a daily weekly, and monthly basis.

Okay. Recent. I don't know why excel doesn't. All our locations.

You talking about and help desk marathon and helped us. Yeah, you know, what is it? Yeah. Like you know, open recent oh this one. Internal enhancements, right? So, this list, Handy. Trevory, saw this before this. It's on the help desk. It's called internal enhancement. So whenever we have some like some some free cycles, i think we should go through this.

Uh, some internally has since Like, for example, Uh, decommission last past. That should be completed by now henry, right? It's not i have i reset the Kelly with Tech Manitoba. She gets to respond to me. I think she might be and Kate. Kate was like Kate okay. Sorry trap what does it k travels?

I think you said she does. She said she would be interested in moving to keep her. So i think i followed a second time, i wanted to still hurt. I've read it back out there because you said she lost that she lost. There you go. Thankfully, we caught that that's good.

We don't, we don't want to piss her off, right? Like that's yeah, she was like, yeah, for some reason. Last person, right. I was like, oh, Yeah, i thought we had reached her like i like when i when i send that suspension list and then next morning, i looked at the email i'm like, wait, did we reach out the cake?

Like i know, bws are done, right? Yeah. And then and then yeah, okay so see i put things in the internal enhancement lists. If you guys Feel free to add more to it, or even like grab one and knock it out when you have some time. Uh, remove abdela from all.

Yeah, like just this one, i can work on, that's fine. But i just added there as implement. I think we much need does not only internally, but also for our clients labs, right? So, labs, for admins EPM, which is important privilege manager for end users. So, essentially, when you get that pop up that user UAC, pop-up, the user account control, and tells you put on your admin, credentials on windows.

Uh, lots of signal there for a second. Oh now for some reason. My oh no. Never mind. Lapse is local admin password solution so it would be It would be for us to Adam is not for the end user for us to have a local admin. Creation that we can put in when a UIC pop-up because i, you know, from a, from a zero trust or security, best packs.

We should remove local admin rights. Users should not have local admin rights. Especially on. On on, on on servers. And of course, Yeah, but of course, again Something like this would be, uh, would be a change. So, for example, Uh, what i would do, i would go say to our Are our support portal.

Did you? Did you suspend my account? Not just kidding. Sign up with SSO. Hey, i'm still here. Thank you. Change. So i go to change and create so, for example, like this one, i've this one is completed now. So, i can just mark this as complete or Closed. Actually before yeah, i'm going to do that.

I'm just going to add a note, i'm going to say You see how so i want, i want to take this as an exam as a really good example. And and i mean, You know, i will tell you this. I i I said, I dictated i like voice recording that like what?

What however you like to do it typing, whatever, i fit that to change. Indeed based on my previous experience. And i said, I i give charge of the sort of the the required section and said, give me a reason for change impact roll-off plan. And of course i mean i i read the whole thing before bringing them over here, backup line.

And i told tragic to what i want to actually to do. Right. And i said, I want to implement a compliance policy for microsoft, Defender onboarding. And i've actually already completed this changes, just for different didn't get a chance to market as close. Uh, so what i did i actually went into Went into.

And into a portal. Add in here. So what that will be something like this, i went into devices. Compliance policies because somebody tell me what's the difference between It compliance policy condition, i suppose in configuration profile is that does anybody know the difference? The technical difference, really? So it configuration profile, Actually makes the change on the device.

So for example, I i say configuration profile to enable bitlocker. Okay, so i can push this is like a group policy, right? Configuration profile. So if i want to actually make the change on the device, Not pushing out just to change, right? I can say, One drive. None folder move the force.

One drive to move to backup, pictures documents, you know, things like that. But a conditional access policy. It controls access. And identity levels and a shape for example, effective block, grant things like that, a compliance policy simply put it's just a measurement date. Doesn't make any changes on a device.

Compile spicy session, say go on the device and measure for me. If the device is on target or off target, meaning a compliance policy. I can measure. If bitlocker is enabled or not, i'm not saying enable, but locker, i'm not saying i'm not saying don't touch bitlock, just measure it for me.

Just tell me, just go to the device measure and come back and tell me the results. That's it. I don't want you to make any changes. And so, with the compliance policy, I can measure if the device has been locker enabled or not. And if it doesn't, i can feed that in conditional access to block access to outlook.

Or teams if bitlocker is not enabled. And with the configuration profile, i can actually enable bitlocker. You see, kind of the, it's a nuanced, small difference, but it's kind of a good, a difference, so measure Block. Make the change. So measure a bit locker is enabled or not block if it's not.

And they make the change. If i actually want to make the change over configuration provide now, the nice thing about compliance policy. Is i can say, If? Computer doesn't have adobe reader installed on it. Block access to unlocking teams so i can again feed it back into contracted so i can have that sticky reminder.

In like popping up before the user visually and preventing them from doing work. If a certain condition is not me. But i'm not saying you make the change. I'm not saying push the app or make the configurable. I'm just saying measure and then feed everything. It's a very powerful, so any type.

So if we're working with with some environments where they have, like, sort of Strict requirements about like TPM for example, a bit locker or something like that. I say, immediately block access to all will contains by thinking that signal into conditional access If with compliance policy and a measurement tape, If it doesn't mean a certain requirement, so that's essentially what i'm saying.

So, In our case in in the change requests that i've submitted, if i go back here, sorry to Uh, to compliance policies. So we i put a compliance policy right here. For empty mic. Microsoft defender for endpoint. And i, i said in this. Change. I said, english combined for market defense boring.

So i'm saying Measure our computers here again, computing, if they are not enrolled in defender block access to our login to use essential, what i'm saying, right? That's what this changes all about. So, it's just saying, measure. I'm not saying enroll the device in defender. I'm just saying, measure, if the devices is enrolled or not an old or sorry, but i guess the right word is onboarded in the defender or not.

Onboarded you'll get a compliance prompt in the middle of the screen and say, hey sorry when you try to ask outward teams, That way we can catch these non-compliant devices pretty easily. Very fairly easy. That's that. So i'd like to follow this. Methodology of implementing changes. Customers here. You know like whenever we make a change it really helps like i can take this And if a customer say, okay, well what changes the kind of computer made for me for the last whatever quarter last year or whatever i can say.

Look at that. That's a pretty and rollout. Plan developed compliance policy, communicate the change. And i did that i actually sent you guys an email deploy. The policy in the face manner. We did that we started with my like, a potted group myself, right, modern complied, status address, technical issues.

So you guys saw that that email where the compliance pop-up is. So, these are very powerful ways to measure. At a certain requirement is met or not, so i can go here. Um, where is it? Sorry the Uh, i guess with the Internal accelerator, internal excel sheet. Implement plats.

So, so whenever you guys making change like this internally or on a customer, make sure you submit a change. And then and then you ask, okay, how do i engage the customer? Like if i'm about to make a change, how do i engage the customer? And you engage the customer by sending an email of the customer getting their approved.

That's how it gets the customer. Like if there is a way to approve. That change that's having got some doesn't approved. Don't, don't proceed with the change, right? Now, at which point you say this is a change request or this is a project. Okay, so he's a change request the same as just Change like change band like a reading about it.

And so, for example, explain change management and change requests to be slightly different. Yeah, so correct. So chi change management is the is the overashing process. Is the entire product, change request would be part of that, right? So so change management would be Would be with really the change request.

And we're also include Um, The board, the change board change advisor today. You can see a b the call, right? So and in other words, so if Trevor is scheduled to, so rebooting a server for example, that would be considered a change. So you shouldn't go and just schedule a maintenance and patch or read what a server without a change request.

Right. I mean i mean we're a small company but you can maybe just get an approved from the client over the phone say. Yeah i go up and go what we still want to track that and so we can we can come up with a template for you putting a service so you don't have to every time fill out their rollout plan the back out, plan and implementation steps.

I'm sorry to interrupt. I think there's a lot of good information. What you are sharing there? Especially the change management. But this is this, yeah, this is good for Us right like for okay when when we have some cycles, okay. What are some of the change enable MFA for customs very important, right?

Driving that we say driving I don't like the word we concluded with value or not value, but driving Yeah, driving excellence and excellent value and everything is like, especially Nowadays like with monocyte, i think these are excellent stuff.

Yeah, if you lose them, you can locate them. That's good. So yeah, we're like slow pants. You can load me. Yeah, but but the location services will only work. A, you have to give it full permissions to always be running. The background, be the, the last time you took the earbud out of the case, it will report a gps location.

Okay, so for example, if like say the last time use it four days ago, it will show you that timestamp the four days ago. It wasn't me as helpful, but but it's like, almost have to be using it on a, but if you say, she's just lost it on a couch or something.

Yeah, you can send a high. Frequency sound. It will make like a high frequency sound ppppppppppppppppp, and you can actually get closer.
