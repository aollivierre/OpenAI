This is part number 2
i just want to clarify why why this was selected now to your other other email there I really appreciate you taking the time there morning to check and yes you're right that indeed we have the remaining end users here and and yeah so and so you know sometimes what happens is just answer question on why even though they connected the VPN sometimes there might be other issues related to you know their computers maybe there's some DNS issues maybe because there's some DNS potential DNS issues maybe even though they connected to the VPN they're not able to reach the domain controller maybe there's some DNS issues maybe there is some other issues maybe the operating system version could be that that's another factor or maybe the certificate the interest certificate that is running on their computer has expired right so there are other reasons why I mean like what I'm trying to say is that for for successful in into an aroma that happen on the computer manik there are other factors involved it's not so one of them one of the requirements to connect to the VPN in order to be able to receive that group policy from domain control but certainly that's not the only factor there right so and I really appreciate you reaching out to the users there Monica really appreciate that give them a heads up or occur over the next few days yeah so you know yeah so so I really appreciate that Monica Nana really really appreciate that Monique for for for a computer #5 there CPA 2019 NB zero 19 for Renee dykeman if we let us know when they have their new computer and we can go ahead and disable this one that way you know we make sure that it's not you know it's not it's not out of compliance you know what I mean because to be compliant you have to be enrolled in Microsoft enter right so then that applies to all Windows 10 and you know and later anything understanding above windows it winced and windows align right so that's our goal is to ensure compliance and having every computer running windows centre later enrolled in Microsoft in the Microsoft intune service so if you think we should we should we should wait for now we're not going to worry about it that's fine we can put it on the side but thanks for clarifying that for for Justin you saying that the number six or Justin a so it looks like see how it looks like 4 numbers number six it looks like you remone checked on that already which is fantastic so Ramona really appreciate you checking on that for number six again for for this one cpha 2021 MB 005 if it doesn't belong to anyone we can go ahead and either either if it's not being used at the moment we can we can either disable it or we have any business ready state where you log in remotely using go to resolve and set up an unattended Asian so we can we can remotely troubleshoot that and see what's going on right but the good news manik is that our message is much much shorter now right so we went from eight computers and again like look look this is This is why we're having these back and forth right where again see what we're wasting cycles on on stale computers or computers that are not assigned to people that are not being used that's exactly what I mean by cleaning Active Directory see the importance of this is an s s instrumental so how can we confirm so we can definitely confirm from the from the from the Azure AD the Microsoft intra portal if there's other devices enrolled you know we can definitely confirm that and see their computer name so so yeah so and so so thanks so much appreciate morning for all your help you're doing and for #7 it's not an essay managed which is SolarWinds yeah I I would say I would say for any device that is currently I would say here generally speaking for any computer right now that we have physical like any physical computer that we have right now in our own hands but it's not assigned to any end user just a computer sitting on the shelf it's not it's not in the user's hands let's go ahead and roll it in Microsoft into it beforehand in preparation to having it business ready state before we handed out so it's treated as if it's a new computer yes it has a new image we should we should open the computer an role in Microsoft intune right so so yeah I absolutely absolutely right so but then you know that user who Oh yeah I think you know what no different never not never mind that you OK so actually let me let me let me let me let me rephrase this let me let me correct this any computer that is currently sitting right now that is not assigned to an end user should be disabled OK should be put as disabled so it's not showing up in our reports because every time I pull this report this report is skewed by the fact that these are stale computers tail they're not assigned to any user So what we would like to do any computer that is currently sitting in the office you know it's just you know sitting there sleeping doing nothing is not being actively used is not assigned to a user should have it as disabled OK we're not going to delete it just have it as disabled put it on the side disable it and then and then and then we're going to we're going to essentially we're going to we're going to we're going to wait until it's handed out for an actual individual who logs into it with who licensed individual who logs into it license meaning they have a Microsoft strike business premium license once they log into it yes it will enroll in in in in in Microsoft Internet right but at least beforehand let's make sure we do a you know we beforehand we make sure you know that we sort of you know we yeah before beforehand we and at least we do yeah we do A at GP update we log into it with a local account yeah like a non hybrid account is right right like a like like log in log into it with a non hybrid account just just a local at a local account there like a local admin yeah just logging log into it with the local admin and just make sure you do a GP update on it just received the policies right yeah and then impression yeah just talking to it with the local admin for now yeah then leave it leave it for the end user to have for the end user to log into it yeah leave it for the end user to log into it I would say yeah leave it for the end user because we need the user credential if we had the user credential sure we can use their user connection but if you don't have the user credential let's leave from the end user 'cause we need to enroll the device as the user the user credentials yeah so let's use the user credential if we don't have the user credential let's then leave it for the user credential by list in preparation it's log in with a local administrator like a non hybrid like just just just a plain vanilla not even domain like just a local administrator and and and and and inhabit to have GP update on it so it received the policies and so once once the user log in they they can enroll it using user credential yeah so so any any computer that is that is not being used we should have it this which we should run Logan *** with a local administrator Rana GP update slash force or receives all the policies from the domain controller and cry and yeah yeah exactly and and and just ensure that it received the policies and then that way it's it's prepared for a business radio state when a user logs into it then then using the user credential it were enrolled in Microsoft into it will only wear row Microsoft intune after the user log into it but at least it would have received all the necessary the prerequisite group policy is in preparation for a user log in once they log in and create a profile and I sent you I sent this to the machine user credential a well then in Roy list at least you know the policies will be already on the
