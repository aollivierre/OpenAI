This is part number 2
to month, we have some on an yearly basis and we have some who are every six months, Um, and also have a breakdown because we were asked to do that. We have a breakdown, you know? Of the top nine customers, for example, on how much Speaker 3 1:07:04 It Speaker 1 1:07:05 Is because the previous slide here. It's not telling you the full picture, right? It's telling you how much you're making, but how much is that a service? And how much is that? How much of that is the service and how much of that is? Is resellable, resellable versus non-resalable. Non-resolve, and resellable is tax and ions, right? Like, like licenses, like Speaker 4 1:07:27 We, for example, licenses, we take them from microsoft and we just With the skin off it. Yeah, we and we add like a little bit of maybe 10 percent, 10 15 percent. Now we just resell it Speaker 10 1:07:39 Just really no value. We're just simply Speaker 4 1:07:42 Taking the license at reselling, so Speaker 1 1:07:43 It's telling you here, if you are interested, you know, we just put a custom one, two, three, just to hide there. 90 years, we want to share with the potential wires. But that tells you a briefly. Um, What's the division? So, who are the example of the very first customer? You guys know it's FGC. Right now, you can see that they're paying 5500 in service, they're paying what we can. I ask that's Azure and they are paying 5k in SAS so that's like their licenses of various different things. All right, so that's that. Now we talk about plants for the future, here is a good a good slide but before i maybe jump into that, we covered a lot of information there in the numbers and Uh, and i'm also Got to watch for the time here. What is any questions? Any questions do you always wanted to expand on that? A little more less. Um, Speaker 2 1:08:39 That's a great slide actually. Yeah, i Speaker 9 1:08:42 Mean, Speaker 3 1:08:42 I guess just the net profit. Speaker 5 1:08:43 Yeah. And that's, that's scaring me. The net profits, like, Speaker 1 1:08:46 I do scared. Absolutely. You know, companies do have like, early stages and, you know, i should say, the year prior to this 20 21, 22, we were probably at Uh maybe like a zero or so, like so we dropped really in the last two years like we made a Huge commitments on different things based on Certain customers decisions and whatnot. And we weren't able. Yeah, it kind of didn't go that way we expected and that's sort of why you see some of that. Um, But what companies in some stages they do go negative profit. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're out of business, it means they're just making more investments. And and you know, hopefully which were very faithful that it will certainly come back to to Uh, i'm optimistic that We still have got two more months. Basically, our fiscal year runs from march to February. That's why you see in the marsh defend. So, few more months i'm very optimistic that will be If not. Positive at least it will be zero and and then hopefully the year after Will be quite a quit. A bit of a different story. What do Speaker 3 1:10:02 You think is like the leading contributing factor that we you know, at least we can risk for at 11 now and i was 64 before. Is that just, you know, we're running tighter as a company. Like, what what have we stopped doing to? Speaker 5 1:10:15 You have to let go appliance, Speaker 1 1:10:17 Yeah. The yeah, the, the very good question. Like, i think you guys because you're in the company, probably can quickly even answer this yourself, but to elaborate, Um, i mean we we as a team sort of reduce our size a little bit, right? So instead of having look at that line above, Speaker 2 1:10:38 Yeah, going from from 330 to 203. Okay. That's a, that's a massive pencil sharp knee exercise that my mood's gone through in the last year. Of how do we streamline and whether that's again product simplification. So we're not paying licenses on a bunch of things. Um, you know, amalgamation of vocation of offices things like that being a little more cognizant about, Speaker 1 1:11:03 You Speaker 2 1:11:03 Know, consultants and when they're needed and things like that. Those those all make a difference right now. Compared to save my Speaker 1 1:11:09 Life. Absolutely well said, right? Thank you. And Speaker 2 1:11:12 Of course, You know, i think if we sum up the marsh or the the 20, the the year 2022, Hey, that was, you know. We had the The Stanley Cup winners, the fgc looking like there were other wave going somewhere, right? And you know hey gave us a sphere of You can't grow fast enough, right? So wanted to be ahead of that. Roll this growth and yet we know what happened there and consequently had to react. And i think looking at that, you know, last column going down there, That's a pretty good reaction. Speaker 1 1:11:48 Yeah. Okay. Speaker 2 1:11:50 And let's, let's remember that companies like Starling. I think it's just now starting to turn profit this year after being out for how many years. Um serious exam, rain bird major Speaker 3 1:12:04 Losses. Until i don't think they're making fun. Speaker 2 1:12:06 I think it's starting this year finally. Speaker 1 1:12:08 But yeah, they don't like, i never knew that. Yeah, Speaker 2 1:12:11 Monstrous company and yet software company. Speaker 3 1:12:15 They're not, they're not providing cabs, they're not like a sign of why is, uh, is it just because they're trying to kick taxis out and eventually they will. And then that's when they'll really start making products because they're total loss is like, out of 500 thousand few million every single year. Like, yeah, it's a total amount of money that they've lost is insane. I Speaker 2 1:12:31 Think that they are probably heavily reliant on. Lawyers working through permits. Litigation issues within every jurisdiction. They're in and try to understand every market. Look how long they fought here to get in. Speaker 1 1:12:47 Yeah. Speaker 2 1:12:48 And somewhere there was probably a team of lawyers working on that, right? Like oh the bury, you know, Speaker 1 1:12:54 The cost is the initial investment. It's Speaker 2 1:12:55 Like very Speaker 1 1:12:56 Steep investment but Speaker 2 1:12:58 If you look at those models air Airbnb, You know, uber lift, whatever they are software companies. All they're doing is saying you're put an app. On your phone, goes through some things to become a driver. But they're not providing services, right? Like they're not they're not buying cabs some places. They might have pilot highly versions but for the most part they're soft workout Speaker 1 1:13:23 Another one too. I don't know if they start to make money but i always Like at least as of last year, Speaker 4 1:13:29 Especially after Elon acquisition, Speaker 2 1:13:31 I don't think he makes money for a while, but I don't think he cares either Speaker 4 1:13:38 Again. Speaker 2 1:13:38 Starling Speaker 1 1:13:39 The Speaker 2 1:13:40 Spacex rates. Speaker 8 1:13:41 Yeah. Yeah. Speaker 1 1:13:43 So yeah, lots lots to certainly understand from this and it is Uh yeah. Some it's it's the numbers theme. You know, numbers don't apply it's sometimes they have hard facts and It's Speaker 4 1:13:56 They don't lie. But they don't also convey the intangible. Speaker 1 1:14:00 Right, Speaker 4 1:14:01 Like Speaker 2 1:14:01 This Speaker 4 1:14:03 Is talking about the tangible but what this this i guess this this slide is and this slide is not convening as the brand, right? We're building a really good brand. Ask anybody, who will look at a website. Like whoa. This is like Speaker 3 1:14:18 Enterprise level. Speaker 2 1:14:19 Yeah, it's a really good website. Speaker 4 1:14:21 Yeah, we've gone through so many iterations on that website. Like the services Fly down menu, the products like that. It's just, you know, so it's silly lots. Still need a lot more work Speaker 1 1:14:33 Here. Speaker 5 1:14:34 Yeah. Speaker 2 1:14:35 And if we look at this like this, this number here, And just go back. Pretty fgc. Look at that. It's not that hard but what's happened in the last two years, too like Everybody's a little more cautious with their money and a little more diligent all of it. So everything is cost more but also people are tightening their belts too. So Now, what is this number look like? If that is the income. Suddenly it's flipped over you go. Oh wow. We Oh, there's a different way that there's a plus net, you know. At least next to it, right? So It doesn't take that much because there's a lot of variables, but i mean, got to be proud of this like this number here. Remember that took a lot of work buddy? Speaker 1 1:15:19 Right? That's yeah. Speaker 2 1:15:21 It there's a wood shavings all over here. All over your office. Some tough decisions. It's very tough decisions. For sure. Yeah, Speaker 1 1:15:31 There's some tough decisions, easy to You know, like, for example, a lot of having to find another opportunity, right? It's not easy to hem to make that decision. Thankfully, it worked out where he had to it's not easy. We had to, you know leave our good office in downtown. It is actually we spend really good time in it. Uh, they're now but you know, you have to sometimes Decide. Okay, when do you have to your emotionals things? But we have to sometimes. Just look at look at what look at the numbers a bit and Speaker 2 1:16:02 And there's good bones here. Speaker 1 1:16:04 Like you say, like, Speaker 2 1:16:05 You know, what is Processes web. Website enterprise look, you Speaker 10 1:16:11 Know, the tools, the vendor Speaker 2 1:16:14 Relationships. You have, there's a lot of good boats. Speaker 1 1:16:15 I've also be a grateful for everybody's support and openness to, for police changes because every change that we made, thankfully, everyone here was just supportive and And even like really just saying, yeah, that's the right thing to do, like, let's move on. And so that's really helpful, you know, like i want to say i'm just grateful and we're really happy that that thankfully else changes have Brought some positive results and brought us even to a lot better positions. Uh, like i don't remember when one incident where we let go of something or we decided to watch out for it. And it causes pain like thankfully. So that just accountability is very important. I think it is what? Yeah, i'm We're grateful to be where we are here and then we'll continue to be to drive to drive. Forward stronger, and yeah. So, Uh, plans for the future. As a company we want to apply to the sbvcdc. It's Speaker 8 1:17:22 A say that 10 times. Speaker 1 1:17:23 Yeah, i say that 10 times. Yeah. Speaker 4 1:17:25 It's, Speaker 1 1:17:25 It's So, that's from a business perspective again team. You know, there are, i think i would like to also chat with you about the technology side of things and where we like things to be Uh, but from a very high level, we want to apply to that. So, what's that? Actually it's, it's a program from the government manager but to incentify Local people to invest in local businesses. It gives it's a tax credit program, it gives 45 percent. To the individuals. In tax credit in Manitoba tax credit because of their investment. So if they invest 50k they get 45% back of that. Uh, And, Uh, it's really like it's a it's an amazing program. I think. So we're going to apply to it as a company to allow people. In the province, who wants to invest. Uh in us we want to focus on speed up more. It's just a something we established and the lade of last year and we're going to grow more on it. There's money on the table. There are businesses want to invest. We've gotten a few customers, reaching out to us from cdap. So i think there's a potential there. We want to build scalable sales process. This is a very important one. We want to build a scalable sales process, not a sales team, not just selling, we're going to build a scalable sales process. How can we make it? You know, we have sold in the past. We've sold, we're secured. Many customers, not not new to us, but how do we make it skill? How do we make a continuous? Always been new customers. Uh, me and john, we chatted briefly with you and me constantly talk about How do we build this, you know? Yeah, the sales process as a matter of fact, next week, i will be connecting with a Coach in New Zealand. At sales coach. Who she worked for a company who sold a lot for microsoft services. And i'm hoping to get a good. A good input from her but you have got some ideas. You know, i think just me being all over the places. And running a small tie chip here, it's not where what? What? Custom ideas? I think we need to collaboration from everybody on this. It is a problem. The team that the company without a good strong sales, Uh, that bottom line will not be raised. So it is a problem. Myself abdullah and i want all of everybody to think about as a problem. How can we put our brain and our energy? And then so we can make it bigger, we can solve this problem. We've got a tech brain. We've got a problem solving brain and deal with this as a problem. How can we apply some engineering? We can chat more about it. But this is one of the things. We want to establish my document that counting and financial process right now. There are different pieces of accounting. Some external team are involved. Some internal team are involved. It's not well documented. We want to work on that. To the last scale. Um, we went optimize the customer journey process from sales to service delivery, right now there's a lot of manual processing tests so you know, we get them to sign on a docuSign form when they join when they become a customer. And then we have to manually enter information in fresh service, in Johor, customer caller presented, a lot of manual pieces. We're going to optimize this journey a little bit. And, We want to expand to new services. Of course, you guys know what the large language models. Things like charging and many others. Are out there and they are very aggressive in the market and a lot of businesses want to get them but they don't know how they don't know how to get these services in a secure seamless way into their practices. We want to participate in that there's a lot of potential there. It's it's a, it's a very, very very, very early stages right now and And we see open hours doing a lot of work. As a matter of fact, just three days ago they introduced A charging 14s. So the interest rate of people enterprise for a little large companies but now they're trying to be and a teams which will allow teams each to have their own charity, and they can collaborate as a team on these There's a lot of potential there just literally came three days ago. Um excited to have bring it to our team as well when they get started. Speaker 2 1:21:38 So i think that goes back to your your solution slides, Speaker 1 1:21:41 We Speaker 2 1:21:42 Discussed automation. Like integration. Automation right. Like how do you integrate? Lms in that Speaker 1 1:21:52 Right in their business. So Speaker 2 1:21:53 That we have a 30 years life is kind of a dual purpose automation and integration. Speaker 3 1:21:58 Love it. Look great. My question there is so if we leverage tools like Microsoft co-pilot or whatever it may be, how are we making money? If we're you know reselling a license and that sort of thing? How can you leverage that for Speaker 2 1:22:12 You're hooking up your plumbing to it, right? You're the You're the plumber either because they're going, hey, there's a tool here. Speaker 3 1:22:18 Yeah, i guess where the kind of one of the leading companies that Puts it on the forefront and showcases it'll be more attractive like our company to potential customers. Speaker 4 1:22:27 I think that's a good question Henry we thought actually yeah we actually discussed that. Speaker 1 1:22:31 And Speaker 4 1:22:31 So, the real value would be And training. Training. Those companies, those enterprise on how to use it, that's a real value, okay? Because like again reselling, licenses that anybody can do that. Speaker 3 1:22:45 You need to. I was like Speaker 4 1:22:46 Oh here's the license. Okay, thank you. Speaker 2 1:22:48 But yeah. And you train train, can you implement it and get that Speaker 3 1:22:51 Like workshops and Speaker 1 1:22:53 Integrated to it, right? And great. Yeah, it comes to Charge ability enterprise for example and try to be teams. How do you connect this with the company data sources? So the company have their own share point, they have their own databases. How do they connect this? The plus rod mentioned, the plumbing? From this engine. So it knows how to bring meaningful answers based on their own data. Yeah, so there's a lot of So and these licenses are not cheap. Speaker 4 1:23:22 And so when like for example in 365, you can look at the user's reports. They're like hmm this company is paying thousands of dollars a month for co-pilot but like only quarter of the companies using it. So Speaker 3 1:23:34 Yeah, we're like a rollout plan or something like that. I think that's a great idea. Speaker 1 1:23:38 I'll be there. It should be Speaker 3 1:23:39 Into one of the first priorities. It's first training. Our staff on how to use it, right? Yeah. Certifications are kind of Interesting. That's it. Yeah Speaker 4 1:23:51 Certified, i'm sorry. Yeah. Speaker 3 1:23:57 It will need to do that, like the advertise it, and then we'll need to find a puppy, that's large enough to actually be able to use it. And then plan, those workshops to Speaker 1 1:24:06 China employees, So love it. Go by certification about it. Look into Speaker 4 1:24:13 Sort of. Yeah we're copa certified hats, that's it. We all learn together. Speaker 3 1:24:19 Share information with each other. I think eventually we're all going to have to know how to use these. Controls right? Speaker 2 1:24:24 Yeah. Speaker 3 1:24:24 Not one of us is going to be over, specialize it and then offers You know that it's going to be a big company that's going to have to leverage them so we're all going to have to play a hand and learning that. Speaker 1 1:24:34 That's right. Speaker 2 1:24:35 Yeah, and then, somewhere in there, developing use cases, right? The show a company. Hey, you know what, we worked with this other company that said we want, You know, some sort of Automation. You know, whether it was a customer phone call in. Uh, there's some sort of chat function there that is answered the questions and Uh, able to get them an answer or a process done. So yeah. How do they get done? And now you can showcase that to the next customer. Speaker 1 1:25:04 I mean, you have the conversation, i'll be right back. She's going to bring the pizza. I Speaker 3 1:25:08 Think like up houses, probably one of the best kind of customers to Use as an example that would leverage that, i mean not the different companies that they kind of Our in communications with just like leveraging, you know, different Contact forms or whatever. They may use and they're very innovative and making videos and they need that creativity, kind of long. Speaker 2 1:25:29 So see that exercise kick. Yeah, and you got to think that there's a A company out there. There's a CEO here in the buzzwords of You know chatty video AI? I got to use this. Yeah. But doesn't have that next, you know? Great. I can go. Leverage the tool. But who's going to hook it up for me, right? Who's going to get that going? And that's where there's going to be probably a lot of work. Um Speaker 3 1:25:54 And Speaker 2 1:25:55 And there's frankly there's going to be a lot of companies that well, they aren't even there yet. They're not using email addresses ready Speaker 3 1:26:01 For them. Speaker 2 1:26:01 But somewhere you can get in on that journey and say great to get you there, we got to take three steps to get there, right? Speaker 3 1:26:08 So again who's telling you that right? Speaker 2 1:26:11 And they might not have a night, a lot of companies don't have an IT person in a little or a department, Speaker 3 1:26:16 Right? Speaker 4 1:26:17 There's right to that point, there's always the hype and then reality, Speaker 3 1:26:20 Oh, Speaker 4 1:26:21 Cyber security bleeding edge. Reality upgrading from server 2012, 2016, right? We're still doing that 16. Yeah. Speaker 1 1:26:32 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Co-pilot certification. Yeah, i wonder there's Is something for that now eh well you know that ms900 Speaker 3 1:26:47 I went through that last plaid thing and like this is so outdated and then they just They actually talked about co-pilot a lot, it wasn't on my exam, but it could tell that they're just pushing that out of Speaker 1 1:26:57 Yeah. Speaker 4 1:27:00 I think, i think if i think with microsoft, Search, if if If the product is still in preview mode? Yeah. They don't, or if certain features in preview mode, they that You're like, you don't encode these in in the exams. Until that product becomes generally available, right? Speaker 2 1:27:18 And remember right now, they bought a They've made a whole bunch of stickers and say, co-pilot and they're slapping it on everything, right? It's all yeah, bing, it's Speaker 3 1:27:26 All. Yeah, Speaker 2 1:27:26 Yes. We've got to also, you know, we read more this and then over the other side of the fence, right? There's Google card whatever. Yeah gemini and they're going with their own stack, right? And then, you know, everybody's got an AI, it's trying to pick one and i think the cool pilot will be good because well, it's going to be baked into office. It's always yeah. Speaker 3 1:27:48 Even what just happened with church bt recently, how they their chair stepped down and all these. So basically microsoft went out their hand and then a higher, like, i don't know, 100 or something like that. Really. Like, Intuitive. And like, Different developers directly from chat GPT over to microsoft. So there's tons of, you know, brands that they've hired direct from them and i was like a two months ago Speaker 2 1:28:10 So i think yeah and we certification that develop once i think microsoft starts to refine what is the co-pilot service right now they're doing this. Yeah it is yeah. Yeah, but they're exciting. The other thing is It's funny because i never would have thought about it. But Speaker 1 1:28:38 And maybe this is for medium size businesses, maybe a little Wow, SharePoint. And what you can do with it, it's Working right now that really high level SharePoint resource. I mean he's building basically apps within that. Yeah. Yeah. And and a workflows and yeah. You know, it's not. It's pretty cool, right? So yeah, is it behind the scenes? You got to think that most companies, Are saying, how can i get by? You know, with less employees. They're not trying to say that they're just saying, okay, i'm at a hard time retaining stuff and getting stuff. And doing more with less, right? Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. So, yeah, it's, it's not something maybe they're trying to do lesson of position of just trying to. Hey, i gotta survive. And i i have three people here on this trying company, right? So where can i get games? And it's going to be interesting to see what. What is a co-pilot means. Baked into the office. The office stack and when's it If you see some of the things that spits over here, Yeah, it's nice to have, though. Especially on marketing and sales creative jobs, right? Yeah, anybody Yeah, which is right here because i didn't like, i didn't think it would take over a creative jobs. I would be like, i thought pretty motivated. Oh, yeah. But so, i want one of the interesting use cases. This actually first hand, right? Like last week, i was, uh, Uh, Setting up into and for one of the organizations work with nova And i needed a like a wide screen background image with strong Canadian identity that reflects the, the industry that they're working at they're in the railway industry. I just went to chat you again and say create me a A background image with those. With those sort of requirements. And it gave me something like out of the board is just wow with the Tim Hortons. And i mean, Yeah. Moose no Burger King please so. The newer version does visuals. It does. So, that GPD. Yeah, it's, that's why they call it multimodal because it can get coding, can does it can do images, if new text, of course, it just analytics, right? Like, it can analyze things. It just, it's, it's so, It's so versatile. What what it? What it does? You just have to think that it's a tool. In your belt that helps you, your productive is. Let's face it. Tragedy. And he can write a lot of code but you still have to be a coder exactly to go through it and say this is real or not, right. Because they're going to be some mistakes in there, that's a lot. A lot actually sometimes. So one thing about chatapy and these elements, they they're very good at going from 10 to 100 but they can go from zero to one. If you can't create something out of nothing. And that's where you still. You still need you. You're the brain, right? Yeah, but if you, if you feed it, something, if you feed it like step, then it can. It can Do multiply that from 10 to 100 and go pretty fast at that. It's pretty impressive. Like for chat GBT like there's other ones, we're talking about image, creations that image, really train the context and you have to like, almost teach it. You know, what is related to what? What challgebt is like super advanced? Like understands contexts that'll get better and in a natural way, right? In a natural language. Yeah. Yeah. So talking about lm actually, i was, uh, To the next point here, trying to establish Ownership with the government of canada for being on their pro services supplier list. Preferred. What spoilers? Which is something very promising. And the gentlemen that i was speaking with his name is Chris, he's actually resizing Calgary. And, Uh, he told me. Hey well Don't want llam. We're at the government here, trying to put an rfp out. For to get the trades, the right trades to help us build a bridge. With llam helped me know which trades. I need to build a bridge. And right away. He said he is not sure, he's not sure if that exists, if LM can help him, And on the phone while i was with him i don't remember a second. I pulled up the phone and told the strategy, how i was working with personal government, they are interested to know which trade will help them, build a bridge. And it just started to talk about all the different trades, the the inspection, the safety, all the hip it blues, his mind he Hey, what's up? Wow. Wow. Like it's just it's just impressive. So that's That's where we like to be. We want to, there's certainly more to add Um, I guess. You know, the food is best when it's hot so i don't want to take you guys away from that for longer but anything you want to comment on anything. You want to perhaps add anything, you like to see in the future in our company. That comes to mind. I think. Your number four there. Document accounting and financial processes. Or just having some it's not even documenting, it's almost having some Some repeatable processes there, right? Like every whatever, every Wednesday, no matter what is when you know review invoices or something. Yeah yeah consistent. Yeah those don't get you know too backlogged or two and then and then you guys can step in either way or whatever producer people process in that. Yeah. Create systems. Not goals, right? I like that create systems not goals. And create a system. So we've got us right, more systematically. Yeah, that's a very good comment, right? Thank you. Anything else? So it's not just documenting technical processes, it's also documenting the non-technical. What, what it takes to actually run the business and much like, strategy, pt somebody's going to be the driver there. Yeah, you're telling an account or or a lawyer and you don't understand those things. That's really tough, right? Oh yeah. You want you want to say, i need this done because i don't have time, right? Yeah. But you're still the domain. I don't understand right. I don't have time. Excellent point drawing. Okay. We have our accounting. Team over like, you know, It's it's brutal. Just yeah, maybe i'll share some of that with you when we grab our pieces, your button. It's yeah. So this next slide, you'll tell you I guess i don't so much any comment, any other points. You guys want to add to here? No, at all. Okay, feel something. I think those are great for kind of coverage of growth in the company. Yeah. One thing about her email a couple like a month ago. Was benefits or a small company, right? And it's not the perceivable feature, but it's, i mean, it's, it's a good thing to, to think about, right? I'm not sure, you know, how much that cost to bring on and it's totally okay, right, you know, looking into that this year but And my sister hike broke a tooth and she needs a root canal and a crown and it's like, 3200. Is that benefits? Oh yeah. So just things like that. Just make you like oh it made me kind of work, you know. But percentage is really about taking, it's a good point about taking the steps to understand. What do you need as an organization first right? Not about the cost, but what do we need right in this game? It's like on sales and process because if i'm the only one working on this on sales team, then Yeah. It's nearly impossible to get. Right. That's right. Because i can do the planning but i'm not good in like rod here, a very articulate to talk to people but You know, i need to know. That's what i feel unstable on the sales process that we have in the company. Yeah, it's doable but it's kind, it's gonna be taking time. It's going to be time. And the value that i add There's nothing because i can't get. I'll say this, it was a common thing. I went to IT nation. Last year that across the board msp said, Had a lot of Time. Can get. You know, they wrote it pretty quickly on trying to land sales. Like and you know this how many calls have you been answered that discussion? Go through the quote, go through the all this exercise to get a Yeah. Thanks for that but never even a responsive and what is that? That means it will actually land them as a customer. You really like those when they can pay, we need something done right now and they're, they're not going on your door right next door here. The great engine. Okay, great, they have money, that's, that's the best kind, right? You didn't have to hunt for it. Yeah. That's how do you develop that? I think it's a struggle everywhere. Is there a tool? Like i'm thinking, okay, whatever a small business used for accounting quickbooks. Is there a similar thing for that helps, you know, automation on state on marketing on emails, chats actually That's what companies are doing. Now, like every Empty hour every day thing, send emails for them. Yes, i'm emails. Okay. But i know in canada, it's not allowed but there's see don't be in received. So there is some of it is allowed to somewhere is not and you have to really know sometimes knowing just oh it's not allowed. That will scare you. And will not get you into the process, but there is a process. Uh, there we do need to That ties back to the scalable sales process. We absolutely need to establish that process and and it starts with a cold calling and the code coin is not Uh, we thought it will be easier but obviously it's not an easy thing. And we do need to create a process around cold calling. And, And cocoaing may not mean may need to be broken into like a few stages. So it's gets a little simpler where stage one would be just calling everybody that you can think about every business that exist, And just checking on them. How are they doing? Any pains any challenges? Maybe tell them something. Cool share with them. Something very insightful like tech and be weak and february. Right? That's a great. Uh, An event that connects people and technology. Tell them about it. Did you know about it? Join us, join us. Anything you can help you with as a company and try to get with a goal of securing a meaning. With them and myself, right to just expand more into their problems and if not, that's no problem that or goes not to sell you or go solution to see. Where we got connect, we got, you know, the word that says and known. People don't buy for me because they forgot about you or they don't know that you exist. Uh so we're going to manually. We're going to collaborate. We're going to even bring this to the team as well. Because team honestly, we do need everybody's help on that area. If we can do it once a week. Or. Uh, or yeah. So that is a big, big problem for the team for the company right now. I just feel bad. We want to. No, no, don't, it's not. It's a big task. Yeah, i think it's simple, though. Because if the what you explained, we know that that's all. There's a lot of work there, right? But maybe it's as simple as we simply. Need a bigger mailing list who you're sending out your messages to And is that you see a lot of companies saying, hey, we're going to give you this whatever ebook white paper pre estimate in an effort to at least get them filling out a form. So now you can mail them That's that's a good idea actually, you can just get killed them. You didn't even have to scour, the earth you never have now, now once they're on your mailing list, You, it's not as bad. So, how do you just make your mailing list bigger? With some sort of. Some sort of giving, right? And whether you've seen those, right, here's your uh Here's your checklist for cyber security. Yeah best practices boom. Sign up here. We'll send it to you. But how do you get those people to come to your page to sign up? On linkedin. It could be on your page. You know as soon as they go there hey would you like to pre-book? It could be. You know, generally goes there's some sort of little promo, there's a little thing in the corner of this. This whatever when i say texas they or your other other ones technique, boom, click here for uh, you know, even if we developed some soil like and put information about your, you know, ex-business, here's the number of employees. Here's what we use. Here's, we're having issues with. If we leverage something like that, they can automate kind of something that. Oh, here's where. You're in business needs help describe to our mailing list. Just like almost let me interactive feature on the website or something like that. Something that can help them. We need to get it. Give them something first. Because even if somebody looked at Canada computing or many other hated their oftentimes Company will have something like, hey, You're interested in services, can we? You want to subscribe to our mailing list our our newsletter, whatever? Right in that process. Bank, the hook is They don't care what they're giving you, it's The real values that they've now got your email address. And now it goes from, you know, sending out a newsletter from you know to 400 recipients to now, hope we get four thousand right, what a big difference, right? John. Let's see how we can maybe take this to the next level. Like this particular idea. Maybe that banner that you already developed to have it on the website. And to get, like, Polish it or adjusted, a lot of it so that People can. Leave their contact to to book with us or to lead their contact to it, at least, get something. But what's that? Something we need to develop that. It's either, you know, leave your contact to book. A free meeting type of thing or or leave your contact to send you. Something. But that's something we still have to think about. Is actually personally advertise it from artists or something muchas by ourselves. There's many avenues here. QR codes that you place, you know, babies and See older and the cold, going back to that. There is like the other day, which i shared with, you would like to joanna is the Uh, like there is a business directory that we found. Uh, like has maybe more than like a thousand contacts in winnipeg. And different businesses, right? And they're, they're Owner as well. So So i think we need to just get the ongoing and just check on them. Like yeah, the more we can call The more chances we will make something count, i think we'll have to make like 100 calls before we can get 10 leads and those 10 leads, maybe one of them will sign up as a customer. And and include it, then maybe i don't want to overuse the example of tank Thursday. But is there an example that i know you put the banner up and sponsored over the brain? Brain, share nine or something. When i think data songs, yeah, it was like, okay, great, is that a chance to say hey will sponsor you and we'll get forward this sort of money or spring for pizza or whatever. Is contact with the context. That's very smart although the right way because yes, Wayne probably have a list of people who are absolutely yes. And if we get that they have a letter, if you can tap into their list of great. That's a very good point. How it can we add these people to attend to our list? And, and From. Yeah, so maybe that third line just becomes it, you know, build scalable sales process plus you know, You know, expand clearly list good point to break. Well, continue on here. Uh, what we would grab a bike and We we travel the discussion. Um, so you're going to tell us what you've gone for us. We've got spaghetti there. That's awesome. Right now. Abdullah's quickly ripping up a meeting a white paper. We published on our website. How to automate, how to integrate chatchee chatting. What high school? I'm here. Let's say something.

We might want to, um, it's a tick place that's called seasick. Or what's it called? Head cheese, more or less blue good, you know that my girlfriend's Vietnamese, but she basically like kind of Oh, choice here. And phase small together. Then you have to, um, Are grilling it first?

Warm it up. Um, Right, since you mentioned you have you'll be leaving shortly. So maybe we'll try to Wrap up here, some of the points. Before we get into the tech aspect of today's meeting, Um, But yeah. So uh You know. We've seen some some of these things here before. So just we usually like to put it for potential investors and others to see what we have. An up to, he started really great initiatives, we have been co-sponsoring in the community. And, Um, Yeah, it really gave us exposure. Gave us a chance to speak. Uh, give us a chance and i an opportunity to also meet others. Um, many talented speakers actually were hosted in these events. We like to play in the role in the community to just, you know, bringing people together and yeah whenever the chance presents itself. We try to take that forward. Um, Yeah, so that's one of the big data science. Meetups. So these are our locations. Mainly we have two main locations and then we have two virtual ones. And, Yeah, we're really strategically located. I think, you know, between the north and the south Um, and i would like to certainly take more. Take advantage. More of these presence area that we're in. What? I maybe the next few slides. You are really just it's just a little more information. You know, there were more tailored for For horizon computers when we were discussing with them, and actually, to give you guys a an insight, perhaps of that it went really well. We had a good meeting last friday, not yet yesterday, but the one before, And was very insightful. This gentleman who will leave the company there. His name is Raj. He has been in business for like 20 plus years, 28, actually. And he leads a team of what 30 people. Uh, They? He grew the company with two other partners. And, and i believe he's the one, he's the only one right now. He liked what we have. It, basically, the next steps for him was to It to engage, a professional valuation company, to basically, look at Areas and go through the numbers. We engaged one locally gave them a gave us a preliminary. Idea how much our company could be worth, but they would like to still But there's a there's a lengthy process basically to get evaluation going and we're going to try to entertain that as we. As we evolve the conversation with this potential, why other buyers as well in other investors, So it's i just wanted to let you know that it's a hell. It was a very healthy conversation, the gentleman, they're invited us for around two basically, another Round out after we. After we get some some more details to him. Um, There's lots that we're discussed, actually, we had, we spent two and a half hours guys, believe it or not, we met fortune up hours on teams. From 3 p.m. i think until 5 30 or six? Yeah, on on friday, not lots when one before Is there any highlights? Maybe you want to? It comes to mind. Do we discussed a lot and he's It's a very well-rounded man. You know. Traveled the world. Yeah, right. Yeah, it's a whole panel there or just, right? I'm done lying. And i, Yeah. Yeah i know what he's a Um, Is a Numbers. Numbers driven, for sure. Sure. He's understanding the yeah entire business. Yeah, he's been. They've had A retail shop before future shop. Like before, there was anything called future or even best spy, or any of these like Like, computer stores, right? They've had a retail before then and they got out of the retail business. And then now they came back there, they bought an apple store. Not to get back into the retail, but it was more of a strategic. Come back so that they can get better at apple. So they bought like, an apple store just so they can strategically Uh, build that arm within the company, right? So, It's a yeah in An interest? Yeah, it's the rose rise of idea, right? It's an interesting. Move from them as well. So, But they have, i would say that apples centric. Retailers or something or service business? Maybe there is not apple itself and saskatchewan. Perhaps there's no apple store like here, right? Yeah. So they there's like a big store like it's known to be only apple like advance or something. So it's known to be the apple sauce. Yeah. Water vagina perhaps. I don't know, like the city games. Yeah, somewhere there. Yeah. But there's an apple store there. Like we have there, so it referred to as the apples store. That. Yeah. But yeah some of the i guess some of the highlights of that conversation is There is a strong. Um, Interest from horizon to buy Canada computing. Conditionally. Uh, they want to evaluate the company. And, You know, evaluating a company. Even a smaller scanning community. It's not cheap. I mean, yeah, or not a quick good to bring it professional company. That property valuates. Um, What. I guess again, the tangible intangible assets of the company is Is a process going to take time and effort, like a biology is a very financial during person. He's just trying it's that's his background. Companies a CEO. Yeah. And he's not Uh, They're very nice guy. Don't misunderstand what i'm gonna say next but he's not open for others to lead the company. Like he mentioned. Again, my goal is to buy companies. They don't like co-leaderships and co-owners and coordinates was not even open to partnerships. You're not even open to having like some of us or the company being on the decision table or on the, but he was up front about it. He's like, i'm gonna buy canon computing. My goal is to keep. The existing team happy as happy as possible to keep them stick around as long as possible. Right. So That's, That's really where there's not like. He would never have a vision of Having a division called county computing. Heat the representation. He did he did commit our brand, right? I said you got a good brand. Yeah, i want to keep it. Your transition into horizon bread but he's like i'm going to keep the brand. A little while. Got a good brand, at least in the Winnipeg Manitoba region. Is it clear? And i'm sure he's pretty savvy. Is he? Is there a Driving reason, you think he wants as he's looking for presence in Manitoba perhaps. He said, he has already five people in Winnipe. It has a team. I don't feel kind of part-time. He said they have customers. They have already owned on the ground. Yeah. It's, it is a strategic acquisition, right? They take Like specializations expertise and kind of Expand that, right? So bring more managed services and gives a footprint in Well, if you think about it gives a footprint in Yeah, right. And with With some work in both Ontario alberta. Political, some of it, some of it is. Have their location in Winnipeg is in one of the co-working spaces that we're not part of Osborne. There is a co-working space there. Um, they're in that location. That's their office. I'm going to be Yeah, so it's a healthy conversation. Well, we'll certainly try to continue the rounds. I guess it does take time for things like that to materialize, but there's not only approach, right? It's not the only, I believe we've got lots more to do in candy computing, and we got our own potential with god. You know, it is. It's an amazing thing that we have built. But it's still. Got a lot to go before. It is really a great. Um, so one approach, of course to find a company like this, they buy us out and, you know, Everybody moves forward. The other approaches of course, to continue to work organically on ourselves, by bringing investors, by bringing partners by expanding partnerships. Uh, by opening up for More brilliant people to lead the company and and continue to be. At the table. To make decisions on how and where this company is moving forward to And and that has its own. Risks and it's on challenges but also it has its own rewards just like where we are today, right? You know, Being able to fully see transparently, see across and through. And and Uh not to say that these things may not continue on when you are part of other companies, depending on their policy, depending on their mentality. Depending on how they do things, it may or may not be something that you can be. Close to. Uh, so what i'm trying to say here, you know, there isn't much in terms of slide. If you just wondering, just really, those are what i wanted to share from a business standpoint. Um, but what i'm trying to get to here is Um, You know, i everybody on this table here today. It has been an amazing teammate to work with it, and And you guys, Honestly, have earned Like, you know, your your I'm personable grateful to me. With you. Oh, and And you have also earned and made. You know. And your position to be also. And just have the right to decide. If you would like to be on the leading team of this company on the awning ownership team, you really have You have Aaron basically your position. To be there. So so i want you to really exercise those rights and, you know, say, well what does it take to to have a seat at the company level? What does it take if i were to bring in a few customers? And what does it take for me to promote this brand to my team of network? That's, Like i'm, you know. I have been in the country in the city for 14 plus years and i have built this much connections. You've got many of all of you have been a lot longer than me. And i'm sure there is valuable networks that you have. What does it take for for? Communication to flow transparently across these networks. From and two, right? Both ways. To continue to grow this brand. This company. Basically, it's an invite for you guys. To, to decide. Be more involved. Uh, So, We wouldn't have this meeting. I mean, let me ask. Why did you guys come on a Saturday? Here. Because You know, there there is you you believe For the spaghetti i think. Yeah, maybe that's one. But uh, but but yeah, yeah we all came because we're we're driven to make something we're not sure. We have some answer things and me too, i have many answer to things. So, Yeah. Me, i have locks to work on. The company has lots to work on as well. What do you guys think? Do I don't know if you're watching what time as well, you don't hold it for longer, but do you think we're Do you think this conversation? Is. How can we equit with this? How can we make ourselves louder? And then it's effective way. I would then this is just outside,
