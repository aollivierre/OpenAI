Alright so I'd like to respond back to Monique era first of all I want to thank you so much I would like for sub out there also thank thank thank you and Ramon Ramon on your sort of dedication and commitment to this project and I really appreciate all your hard work and and you know your your input and guidance has been have been absolutely instrumental in this in this project and so so yeah I really I really appreciate all of your input and I just look I just want to clarify something here that the right now as as as as as I mentioned you know we have eight computers that are pending into enrollment so and so I I just want to clarify so what's what's what's happening here so so those computers are showing as the reason we we picked on this we picked it because those eight computers are showing so there's a number of factors that we number of numbers sort of variables that we factored in with our selection criteria here why why these 8 remaining we want to go after these 8 remaining right because obviously we have done some some we have we have sort of cross a major milestones so far in device cleanup switch clean up a lot of stale devices there and so the reason those are 8 remaining there's kind of want to focus on these last eight here of computers that are not enrolled in Microsoft intune is because of number of reasons little factors multiple variables here so the first thing is the fact that these computers are are active showed as active within the last 90 days on the domain controller OK so I just verified that and indeed all these eight computers actually do exist in the domain controller now it could be possibly that maybe at some point these computers maybe were renamed and in the old computer object was was sort of left behind in controllers if you guys think if so or not if you guys were obviously based based on on ramone Ramones input there we can go ahead and certainly sort of D this table the activator disabled these these computers are there computer objects that are no longer and and that's that's that's great that's great news that means it brings our our list of appending computers down by you know by factor of no by I don't know bye bye how many bye baby bye bye ten 2030% so that's good that means we did we have we have less computers to worry about so if rim on if Ramon you know based on Ramon suggestions and based on remote input and I really appreciate your input on this remote as well so I mean you're saying we don't have laptop named cpha to 2023NB004 so so based on that I can go ahead and mark this computer as I could treat this computer as a stale computer and an sort of disabling deactivated isolated and disabled with the other computers and that means we have less computers to worry about and that is absolutely great news that really appreciate your input on this remote and I think this is the the fruit of this collaboration is be able to find what is truly remaining right and that's against go back to our discussion for stale computers right and the importance of of in maintaining maintaining a clean Active Directory right so if we don't have such a computer like if there is no such computer physically exist if there is obviously no actual individual or user associated with this computer then we can safely go ahead and mark this treat this computer as tail and then obviously with that we can action it and go ahead and market you know disable that that computer object and move it to the isolated and so so again the reasoning again to answer your question Monique the reasoning I went with with with III have those names remaining because again those this report might be skewed and obviously we just found out that it is truly indeed skewed by by by stale computer objects right remember how many times we talked about the importance of cleaning keeping a clean Active Directory for efficiency for an effort to streamline and you know our efforts right to the so now we're wasting wasting cycles on stale stale computers and here we are of course exactly as you see we're having discussions back and forth about computers that don't even exist anymore and so again brings me back to the important discussion of having a clean after directory but I do want to I don't want to say your efforts in in pointing out those those computers in your intimate knowledge of that environment I think it's commendable and and well not only commendable but it's instrumental in actually finding out what is truly sort of was truly active versus versus what's truly you know what is that what is stale right so so so so this is this is going to be instrumental and I think you know the great news here that that that are are dedicated on site Ramon Ramon is you know you're Raymond really you know he he you know he's you know his his input is appreciated right so so yeah absolutely his his input is absolutely appreciated on this and I really appreciate your input on this room 1 and so so so I I just want to say something that that you know that Ramona really really appreciate your input on this and that's great so so if we don't have laptops named that that such we can go mark this market essentially right and so the other computer that you're mentioning there ramone cpha 2021 N B005 so really appreciate input on that as well to Ramon thank you so much for that and if we don't have anybody so can we can we can we install is it possible that we can you know like if this computer is going to be there's any plans to assign this computer to anybody I say let's go ahead and and have it have it any business ready state and have it enrolled in Microsoft intune so if you can go ahead and install go to resolve on it I can I can send you here I'll actually send you a link on this e-mail here I'm including a link on this e-mail here for the go to resolve unattended Asian civic install that agent on the on the unit on the machine that would be would be much much appreciated an I would really appreciate you know you are doing that as well Ramon if you can install the go to resolve because that's going to be our sort of action plan or attack plan here right so essentially all computers that are remaining or going to be contacting the users were going to be working with them closely to install the unattended Asian so that we can have ability to remotely access their machine and and and you know and be able to troubleshoot without you know an as needed you know sometimes needed you know without having to you know essentially so we're able to access mean it doesn't have to be unattended right maybe it's a one time but at least since this computer there's no one is using it at the moment so give us a little flexibility so we can mix mix and match between maybe the unattended agent and the sort of the the the one time agent right so so yeah if we can do that there will be that we much appreciated yeah aside from that really you know what else we have here so those those are the two really two computers that you pointed out ramona really appreciate you you're pointing out as although I I do want to clarify Ramon that that you know I I do want to clarify Ramon that that that computer cpha 2023 NB 004 I do see the last logon timestamp for this computer on the domain controller as February 23rd so on February 23rd I see a last logon attempt so obviously it's been awhile right I mean February is quite some time ago alright so we're in may now so I almost almost ended me right so so so we're I think I think by now probably you know we could we definitely mean since the last logon temples February on that computer object on that specific computer object maybe it was renamed after like and then maybe this name left was behind then we can certainly you know go ahead and mark and mark this and mark this as a stale computer so i really appreciate appreciate your input on this so i just want to clarify why why this was selected now to your other other email there I really appreciate you taking the time there morning to check and yes you're right that indeed we have the remaining end users here and and yeah so and so you know sometimes what happens is just answer question on why even though they connected the VPN sometimes there might be other issues related to you know their computers maybe there's some DNS issues maybe because there's some DNS potential DNS issues maybe even though they connected to the VPN they're not able to reach the domain controller maybe there's some DNS issues maybe there is some other issues maybe the operating system version could be that that's another factor or maybe the certificate the interest certificate that is running on their computer has expired right so there are other reasons why I mean like what I'm trying to say is that for for successful in into an aroma that happen on the computer manik there are other factors involved it's not so one of them one of the requirements to connect to the VPN in order to be able to receive that group policy from domain control but certainly that's not the only factor there right so and I really appreciate you reaching out to the users there Monica really appreciate that give them a heads up or occur over the next few days yeah so you know yeah so so I really appreciate that Monica Nana really really appreciate that Monique for for for a computer #5 there CPA 2019 NB zero 19 for Renee dykeman if we let us know when they have their new computer and we can go ahead and disable this one that way you know we make sure that it's not you know it's not it's not out of compliance you know what I mean because to be compliant you have to be enrolled in Microsoft enter right so then that applies to all Windows 10 and you know and later anything understanding above windows it winced and windows align right so that's our goal is to ensure compliance and having every computer running windows centre later enrolled in Microsoft in the Microsoft intune service so if you think we should we should we should wait for now we're not going to worry about it that's fine we can put it on the side but thanks for clarifying that for for Justin you saying that the number six or Justin a so it looks like see how it looks like 4 numbers number six it looks like you remone checked on that already which is fantastic so Ramona really appreciate you checking on that for number six again for for this one cpha 2021 MB 005 if it doesn't belong to anyone we can go ahead and either either if it's not being used at the moment we can we can either disable it or we have any business ready state where you log in remotely using go to resolve and set up an unattended Asian so we can we can remotely troubleshoot that and see what's going on right but the good news manik is that our message is much much shorter now right so we went from eight computers and again like look look this is This is why we're having these back and forth right where again see what we're wasting cycles on on stale computers or computers that are not assigned to people that are not being used that's exactly what I mean by cleaning Active Directory see the importance of this is an s s instrumental so how can we confirm so we can definitely confirm from the from the from the Azure AD the Microsoft intra portal if there's other devices enrolled you know we can definitely confirm that and see their computer name so so yeah so and so so thanks so much appreciate morning for all your help you're doing and for #7 it's not an essay managed which is SolarWinds yeah I I would say I would say for any device that is currently I would say here generally speaking for any computer right now that we have physical like any physical computer that we have right now in our own hands but it's not assigned to any end user just a computer sitting on the shelf it's not it's not in the user's hands let's go ahead and roll it in Microsoft into it beforehand in preparation to having it business ready state before we handed out so it's treated as if it's a new computer yes it has a new image we should we should open the computer an role in Microsoft intune right so so yeah I absolutely absolutely right so but then you know that user who Oh yeah I think you know what no different never not never mind that you OK so actually let me let me let me let me let me rephrase this let me let me correct this any computer that is currently sitting right now that is not assigned to an end user should be disabled OK should be put as disabled so it's not showing up in our reports because every time I pull this report this report is skewed by the fact that these are stale computers tail they're not assigned to any user So what we would like to do any computer that is currently sitting in the office you know it's just you know sitting there sleeping doing nothing is not being actively used is not assigned to a user should have it as disabled OK we're not going to delete it just have it as disabled put it on the side disable it and then and then and then we're going to we're going to essentially we're going to we're going to we're going to wait until it's handed out for an actual individual who logs into it with who licensed individual who logs into it license meaning they have a Microsoft strike business premium license once they log into it yes it will enroll in in in in in Microsoft Internet right but at least beforehand let's make sure we do a you know we beforehand we make sure you know that we sort of you know we yeah before beforehand we and at least we do yeah we do A at GP update we log into it with a local account yeah like a non hybrid account is right right like a like like log in log into it with a non hybrid account just just a local at a local account there like a local admin yeah just logging log into it with the local admin and just make sure you do a GP update on it just received the policies right yeah and then impression yeah just talking to it with the local admin for now yeah then leave it leave it for the end user to have for the end user to log into it yeah leave it for the end user to log into it I would say yeah leave it for the end user because we need the user credential if we had the user credential sure we can use their user connection but if you don't have the user credential let's leave from the end user 'cause we need to enroll the device as the user the user credentials yeah so let's use the user credential if we don't have the user credential let's then leave it for the user credential by list in preparation it's log in with a local administrator like a non hybrid like just just just a plain vanilla not even domain like just a local administrator and and and and and inhabit to have GP update on it so it received the policies and so once once the user log in they they can enroll it using user credential yeah so so any any computer that is that is not being used we should have it this which we should run Logan *** with a local administrator Rana GP update slash force or receives all the policies from the domain controller and cry and yeah yeah exactly and and and just ensure that it received the policies and then that way it's it's prepared for a business radio state when a user logs into it then then using the user credential it were enrolled in Microsoft into it will only wear row Microsoft intune after the user log into it but at least it would have received all the necessary the prerequisite group policy is in preparation for a user log in once they log in and create a profile and I sent you I sent this to the machine user credential a well then in Roy list at least you know the policies will be already on the machine but it won't be in enrolling into until they the actual user logs into it right so yeah yeah aside from that that's that's pretty much it so we're not going to so that's that's good so that means let's go ahead and so OK so for the users one through 4 Paul Tony Julian claudian let's schedule it for next week on on Tuesday and Wednesday maybe let's have Paula Poland fallen Tony Paul and Tony on on Paul and Tony on Tuesday and then let's have Julian claudian on on on Wednesday and what I mean by that is that we're going to remote reach them out let them give them a heads up you gonna reach out to them via teams and say hello hi this is you know you know you know this is this is the right from Nova we want to connect to your computer here's the link to install the remote access right there more agent so we can share the screen we can take a look and see what's happening make sure that we're able to connect you add GPO do a GP update maybe see if there's any DNS issues or any OS licensing issues or anything like that and then we can troubleshoot from there so let's have Poland Tony on Wednesday on Tuesday on Tuesday and julian cloudy on on on on on yeah on wednesday as well that way too and that way we can we can tackle the risk that's perfect thank you thank you so much for your help and it really looking forward and eager to get this this rollout enrollment
