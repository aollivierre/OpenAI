hello and welcome to the last session of the event have you guys had a good time so far I hope so
I hope it's been good for you my name is Dan Holm and as you can tell from my accent I come from the United States in
fact I live in Hawaii on the island of Maui so I flew in day before yesterday
halfway around the world and if I sound a little hoarse it's because I picked up a cold on the airplane but it's my
pleasure to be with you here today and to share with you my insights into best
practices in administering Active Directory a little bit about myself I
have spent 17 years as a consultant an author and a trainer serving global fortune 500 sized organizations the one
I can talk about in public is NBC television which is one of the major networks in the US for whom I'm the
Microsoft technologies consultant during the broadcast of the Olympic Games and so I've been involved in Torino Beijing
Vancouver and now we're getting ready for London and that involves implementing many of the best practices
that we're going to be talking about here today I also have my own consulting firm in tell'em I'm the chief evangelist
for SharePoint for a company called outpoint and I'm an author for Microsoft press the my book is listed up there and
for those of you who will be administering Active Directory I highly
recommend this book solely because it's one of the few books out there that tells you how to do things that you
can't do out of the box with Active Directory so many of the tricks I'll be showing you today if you like them
there's a lot more in that in that particular resource my email address is up here as well and I encourage you to
always feel comfortable to email me my job is to help the community do better
with the technology so I'm more than happy to answer questions whenever I can and I will be posting the slides and the
scripts to my SkyDrive later on today or perhaps tomorrow so the URL is there and
I will tweet that URL right after the session my twitter handle is at dan home so with that we've got about 53 minutes
to cram in about 20 years worth of or 10 years worth of the industry's experience
with active rectory I began working with Active Directory in 1998 when it was windows in
t5 Oh alpha and then of course Active Directory came out with Windows 2000 in
production and since then a lot has changed and you all are entering a
really exciting time in the in the world of Active Directory things have changed things are changing it in faster and I
want to help you understand first of all what has changed over the 10 years that have passed so that when you hear people
and you see people implementing practices that are old that you know how to do it better and also you know why it
was done that way in the past so that you can help your your employers and and
your enterprises do better so we'll start with Active Directory design building a domain and a forest from the
ground up and then we will also spend a lot of time with tricks and tips for how
you can go beyond the out of box tool set and administer Active Directory more
effectively so the first thing we'll talk about in your Active Directory is the domain controllers themselves when
you install Active Directory on a domain controller you should really entrain controllers
clean that means don't have your domain controller doing other things that makes it a bigger security risk
it adds risk for updates and and so keep your domain controllers clean and doing
their jobs and one way you can help that happen is leveraging virtualization
virtualization is obviously the way of the future and in the case of domain controllers you can virtualize a domain
controller and thereby keep that virtual machine focused on the one task of supporting your Active Directory so even
in a small business where maybe you have very few servers instead of having your
domain controller be a file server and a print server and an exchange server instead put your domain controller in a
virtual machine and and allow other roles to be hosted either on the
physical box or on other virtual machines another thing you can do to help out your the security of your
domain controllers is to use read only domain controllers which allow you to put a domain
controller in a physical location that is less secure so if you have a remote office for example you can put our drum
read only domain controller there and it will be able to authenticate users but if it gets compromised that domain
controller cannot infect and and corrupt the rest of your directory now the one
piece of advice I'll give you about remote read only domain controllers is that you must be sure you've tested them
in production before you expect them to work there are some applications out
there some third-party applications and services that don't that weren't really coded correctly they don't work
effectively against read only domain controllers and the only way to know that is to actually test it so read only
domain controllers are a great feature Microsoft is right to talk about the value that they provide but do make sure
that you that you're confident they will work for you in production up to the -
up to the domain level itself I'd like to talk about forest and domain design because ten years ago when people
started with Active Directory the design goals were quite different than they are now
and so let me actually whiteboard this here and we'll describe it in the early
days of Active Directory and was common to use multi domain forests where you
would have a single domain and then you would have child domains and within a single forest and your force might even
be just two domains and this top domain was often called an empty forest root
where it would be a domain without any real users or computers or resources but
it would represent the enterprise where as all of the real users and computers would be in child domains one or more
child domains the design concept at the time was that Active Directory would eventually allow
us to merge with another company and simply take their domain and graft it to
our forest that capability never came out and so the the potential that a
multi domain and forest and an empty domain root had would has generally not been real
in the community in fact what we found over the years of experience is that as
soon as you have more than one domain in your forest you actually make security and manageability much more difficult so
multi-domain forests are really out and instead you really should dominate design a single domain and within that
domain secure the service accounts secure the major administrative accounts
effectively in order to isolate them rather than put them in a separate domain another thing that used to be
very common is if we had our company company a and we were partnered with another company Company B we would
create trusts between those domains windows trusts and windows trust relationships would allow us to have
user accounts from our partner company and we could assign those accounts
permissions to a resource in our domain as long as we trusted that domain that
was a very common model for many many years even going back before Active Directory and these days that model is
starting to break down for a number of reasons first of all it is difficult to secure perfectly then there are a couple
of features that you can add including a selective authentication and advanced
encryption of the trusts to make them more secure however it still involves
going through firewalls with ports that most companies aren't comfortable opening up and so the new the new world
is really about federating identity and using Active Directory Federation services and similar authentication
services to authenticate users rather than windows trusts so with Active Directory Federation services you can
authenticate users against a partner domain using standard protocols and ports and a set of standard services so
keep your eye on Active Directory Federation services it's part of Active Directory it is now in version 2 it's a
very important technology and my guess is that in Windows 9 we're going to see
that Active Directory looks a lot more like Active Directory Federation services does today and a lot less that then Active
Directory looks like today the world is moving towards claims based authentication and I believe that that's
where Microsoft will end up taking the product as well just as an industry observer so old-school domains
old-school trusts are really out and you really should be looking at single domain forests and when you need to
partner with another organization look at identity Federation with tools like Active Directory Federation services
within a single domain within your domain you have to think about your design of your organizational units and
this is where we will jump into an eel domain here when you design your active
directory and you look at the structure of organizational units you want to be sure that you've designed your
organizational units to manage security first now the reason I emphasize that is
in the early days of Active Directory people would also design Active Directory to support group policy and
they would create oh use solely so that they could link a group policy object to the öyou and that has turned out to be
in most cases a less than effective design so let's take a look at an actual
Active Directory design here if we go into our domain we can see that the
organizational units are are really focused on object classes for example we
see user accounts and servers the reason that it's important to design Active
Directory for security is that permissions must be propagated through
the directory you're going to assign permissions on this oh you for example that your helpdesk can reset user
passwords and you want that permission to be propagated effectively through the objects in your Active Directory so
rather than splitting out user accounts we put user accounts in a location that
allows our helpdesk to have a single point of delegation and we can manage that delegation and those permissions
effectively when we look inside these OU's we'll see a little bit more detail for example and our client computers oh
you we have the ability to as Universal permissions for example we
might have again a centralized helpdesk that is able to perform tasks for any computer but we might also have regional
offices for example an office in London or an office in Sydney and we have
helpdesk we have a local desktop support there and we want that local desktop support to be able to join a machine to
the domain for example by creating a know you to delegate that permission to we've given ourselves an effective way
to delegate one time to that local desktop Support Group so it's quite
common to see a know you for client computers that's divided into regions to
reflect the local desktop support delegation needs when we look at something like the servers oh you this
is something you would see that would be fairly common where each type of server is in its own oh you because typically
there are teams of administrators who manage those servers and so they can be given permissions to their o you to do
things like join a server to the domain so we end up finding that object based
models and often reflect the delegation needs of businesses so this is a very
common model but the real point is that you need to focus on delegation and on
the assigning of permissions and making it as simple and effective as possible because that's what Active Directory is
really designed to do as a database is create a structure through which
permissions can be propagated now when it comes to group policy when you get
down into your design after you've already after you have designed it for security you might find that you have a
know you that you can link a group policy to and that's great if your design also supports group policy that's
excellent but as we'll see in a moment most organizations have found that it's
more effective and more manageable to work with group policies by link by
filtering them to a group rather than to linking them to a know you so for example if we go up to our group policy
management
we can see that at the level of our domain we've linked oh use for example
we've linked group policies for example a group policy that deploys Adobe Acrobat or that deploys VLC player these
group policies are linked to the domain and filtered to a group so that in order to when we want a user or a computer to
receive these applications we put them into the group and it doesn't matter where in the domain they're located
because a computer or user can only live in one organizational unit but it can belong to multiple groups so most
organizations have found that filtering group policies based on group membership
is a more effective way to manage group policies let me take a quick look and yeah so let's uh let's move on to the
concept of group policy group policies and we've just been talking about
scoping group policies and scoping group policies is the concept of deciding how
a group policy object applies to your environment and you can scope a group
policy several different ways you can scope a group policy based on linking it to a site and domain or an
organizational unit but that and in some cases that works but in most cases it's not really flexible or manageable enough
you can also scope a group policy based on WMI filters and WMI filters allow you
to query the hardware and determine whether a group policy applies so for example we could say apply this group
policy only if a machine has more than two gigabytes of RAM or if it has 20 gigs of free hard disk space WMI filters
are interesting they're effective but they're the most performance intensive
way of filtering group policy objects because if you use a WMI filter the
computer the client has to actually run that query during the group policy application process which can take time
so it's a it's a the best practice is not to use WMI filters unless you have
something that is truly dynamic and is likely to change regularly so for
example instead of creating a group policy that uses a WMI to decide whether a machine is Windows 7
that's very performance intensive create a group of computers that are Windows 7 that doesn't change very often when you
upgrade a machine you can add it to the group and you then don't need to be running a WMI filter all the time so
groups end up being the most effective way to filter Group Policy objects and and two points about using groups to
filter Group Policy objects let's create a new group policy we'll call this an
thwart policies and let's say that we want this group policy to apply to users
and computers in antwort now I've already got a group called let's see
where is it oh I reset my virtual machine so we'll create the group first we'll create a
group for Antwerp users and computers and then when we want to filter this
group policy object by default a group policy object will apply to all users
and computers the authenticated users group we remove that and we add the one
group that we do want Antwerp users and computers now if you do this this will
work for the group policy the group policy will now only apply to those users and computers but the problem is
an administrator who isn't in that group when they open the group policy
management console what they will see is
something that indicates that this is an unknown group policy they won't actually
be able to see this they'll see a blank spot in the group policy which makes it
tough to for an administrator to work with it makes it difficult to troubleshoot the group policies so if
you filter a group policy object to apply to only one set of users you
should also go to the delegation tab and give the authenticated users group read
permission you give that group read permission but you do not give the group so if I can find
it here there we go you do not give the group apply group policy permission so this policy will
not apply but they will be able to read it and that simply means that an administrator will be able to see that
the group policy exists in the troubleshooting tools you won't get messages about unknown group policy
objects so when you do filter a group policy object do give the authenticated users group read permission that makes
your life a lot easier the other thing that you want to do with group policies occasionally is you want to deny group
policies from applying to a group so in this case let's say we've got this group policy object and we want to prevent it
from applying to the Antwerp users in order to do that we can't we cannot use
this user interface we have to go back to the delegation tab to the advanced button and we add our ant work group and
we deny that group the apply group policy permission so that's how we block
the group policy from applying to a single group when you do that
unfortunately it doesn't show up here so when you look at the group policy object
you can't really tell that it applies to everyone except and for abusers you actually have to dig deeper into the
into the user interface to find that which is unfortunate but that's the way the interface works now whenever you
create a group policy object I encourage you to have one group created that will
allow you to deny that group policy even if you know one needs to be denied now there usually comes a time when there's
problems that need to be solved and in troubleshooting you want to start removing Group Policy objects from a
user or a computer so my recommendation is every time you create a group policy object create some kind of group that
allows you to deny permissions so that
you can exclude a user or computer if necessary from a particular group policy so we've looked at the domain we've
looked at we've looked at Active Directory we've looked at group policy
and we looked at OU's our next step is going to be to look at sites but before I do that are there any questions about
the pieces we've talked about so far and if there are you might have to shout out because I can't necessarily see
everybody okay now on sites active
directory sites are logged well sorry my pinout active directory sites are
logical objects that represent areas of high connectivity and these tend to lead
to a lot of confusion and organizations because they think when an organization thinks of the word site they think oh we
have a site in Antwerp and we have a site in Brussels and we have a site in New York City so they think about sites
geographically active directory sites are logical objects that don't represent
a geographic area they represent an area of high connectivity so if you have high
connectivity in Antwerp and Brussels those two geographic locations might be
a single active directory site but if there's a slower or more expensive link to New York New York might also have be
its own active directory site now in the early days of active directory the industry was very
concerned that Microsoft would bring down their networks with lots of replication traffic people didn't trust
Microsoft to do it right but what what have proved is that Microsoft did a very
good job in designing Active Directory replication it's very robust it's very efficient and in addition over time
networks have gotten much better so the kinds of connectivity we see even in our own homes is better than most businesses
had 10 years ago so because both people's understanding of replication
has it changed and network technologies
have improved we now have a situation where when you look at your environment
you might think well we have good connectivity between all of these sites and if that's the case we could get by
with a single active directory site and many organizations are doing that now be
because they have such good connectivity the problem is that sites are for more
than replication of traffic sites are also used to help locate resources close
to you when those resources are replicated and distributed in multiple locations so for example you can have a
file server that contains important information in Brussels and if the in
flight if the information is that important you might also have it replicated into a server and Antwerp
using DFS are distributed file system replication and you might also have it
replicated in New York with DFS R now if
users are accessing these resources using DFS in distributed file system
namespaces DFS n will allow you to get users to the closest copy of that
resource the DFS n is site aware as are several other technologies within
windows but if you only have one site a user in New York might very well connect
with the copy of the resource and Antwerp which might not be so efficient and so even though you might be able to
get by with one site from a replication perspective you actually find these days
you need more sites in order to support localization of services so that users
are getting things from the most efficient location so I've been in a number of companies that are starting to
create single sites and then realizing that they need to go and create more sites than maybe they even had before
simply to support localization and in addition we're finding that you'll when
you do that you create sites that don't have domain controllers so for example if Antwerp and Brussels are highly
connected you might have your domain controller only in Antwerp you may not
have a domain controller in Brussels but you may create two separate sites in order to support localization of a
service like DFS so you end up with sites without domain controllers and when you do that you can implement
what's called coverage where you tell the Brussels site that it should use the
domain controller in and rather than the domain controller in New York City so we think about sites as a
way of localizing resources be aware of what you have out there and and and what
sites are really used for related to sites are subnets each site is actually
defined by the IP addresses that it has so if we have a range of addresses like
ten dot zero dot one dot zero it that
would define the Antwerp site and maybe 10.0 2.0 defines Brussels and it is the
linkage between the subnet and the site that allows a computer to know what site it's in and therefore to get resources
more effectively so if we go in and look at our interface in Active Directory sites and services we see subnets are
defined and each subnet object is linked whoops each subnet is linked to one and
only one site so when you the key takeaway here is that it's very
important that every address that a computer might get in your enterprise has a subnet that associates it with a
site because if a computer gets an IP address that isn't defined as a site it
basically has no clue where it is and it makes very bad decisions about where to authenticate and where to get resources
from so whenever in a large organization where you have DHCP servers and and
you're adding scopes to your DHCP servers it's important that every time you add a scope you also associate it
with a site and have some sort of process to ensure that happens in Active Directory
so those are some tips on sites and subnets and then finally there is
replication and as I mentioned replication has proven to be quite good
our networks are quite fast and if you have multiple sites let's go back yet
one more time here if have multiple sites defined so we've now
defined three sites Antwerp new Brussels and New York and we have domain
controllers in Antwerp and New York they are going to replicate with each other using what's called inter site
replication within a site if you've got multiple domain controllers let's say
you've with two domain controllers in Antwerp two domain controllers in New York those domain controllers will
replicate with what's called entrust site replication now in trust site replication is very very very fast when
a domain controller gets a change it tells its partners I've got to change
you want to come get it and the partners come and get the change and that usually happens within about fifteen or thirty
seconds so replication is very fast using what's called notification based replication one domain controller
notifies its partner that it has changes between sites it's very different between sites there's a process called
poling where the bridge head server from one site calls up the bridge head server
from the other site and says do you have any changes and that poling can only happen at a minimum of 15 minutes so
there can be a very big time lapse between when a user is added to a group
in New York and when that user can actually be part of that group in Antwerp that time lapses can be very
painful and and it really doesn't help much if you have relatively good connectivity if you have good
connectivity between these two sites there's no reason why you should be waiting 15 minutes to get those changes
and what you can do is you can implement what's called notification based replication between the sites so that
allows the inter site replication to happen at the same 15 to 30 second
interval as the intra site replication and I have one customer who has offices
all over the world they changed their site replication to entrust to
notification based replication and now their entire global Active Directory converges in 37 seconds and what that
means is any change that's made anywhere in the world within an average of 37 seconds makes it to every other domain
controller in the world and as long as you have relatively decent connectivity that's perfectly
fine because the amount of traffic that is replicated doesn't increase that much
when you use notification based replication the same changes have to make it across the wire the difference
is you're not waiting 15 minutes and getting a whole bunch of changes you're getting changes as they happen a more
steady stream of small changes so notification based replication is another big change that I encourage you
to help your your employers in your enterprises understand any questions on
site subnets replication that those kinds of pieces okay
now on to administrative roles you're you are or you're going to be an administrator of Active Directory it's
very important that you follow the best practice of having multiple accounts you need to have one account for you as a
user and you need to have other accounts that have privileges and that's a very common best practice I hope you've all
learned that so you you log on as a user without privileges and then you use run
as to run your administrative tools with higher-level credentials and if you are
also a domain administrator I encourage you to have a third account that is at
that level because on a day-to-day basis you don't need to be a domain administrator you can be you can have an
administrative account that has the permissions it needs to manage users and manage groups and manage computers and
you can use that second account on a day to day basis the only time you need to be a domain or
an enterprise administrator is when you're making very significant changes and so it's best to isolate that into
yet a third account if you are that privileged in your organization now in addition there are certain accounts in
Active Directory that already are highly privileged of course including the domain administrator account the
administrator account in the domain that account is super privileged so it is an
account you really never should log on as you can create your own account that has lots of privileges but keep that
account reserved for emergencies and I have a lot of my big clients lock it
down to the point we're in order to log on as the domain administrator two people each have part
of a password that together can be used to break into that one account and log on to it you also have groups in Active
Directory that have a lot of power domain administrators Enterprise admins schema admins and these groups should be
kept empty for the most part so let's take a quick look at these groups here
so we have domain admins Enterprise admins schema admins also falls into
this group there's really no need for these accounts to have very many users
in them so keep them as empty as possible and again perhaps with special
identities that you really only need when they're necessary with this schema admins group specifically can remain
completely empty until the time when you Ackman need to make a schema change and then there are some specific groups that
are legacy groups that you need to watch out for these are the built-in groups and they all have the word operators in
them these print operators server operators backup operators these
accounts are highly problematic they were put into Active Directory in order
to support backward compatibility with Windows and T they have too many privileges in Active Directory they're
over credentialed they don't align with business requirements today and additionally if you put an account in
one of these groups it becomes protected in such a way that the permissions that apply to that account are different than they would
normally be it becomes more difficult to change that accounts password and all kinds of other things happen as well and
if you want some details on the on exactly what I'm talking about you can look up admin SD holder which is the
problem that happens when you add an account to these so instead of using these groups don't and create your own
groups that have the privileges they need to do a backup you can give any group the right to backup a server you
can give any group the right to log on to a server you can delegate management of user accounts do it with custom
groups rather than using these legacy groups and Active Directory and also do
be sure to audit changes to these groups particularly domain admins Windows Server now includes directory
service change auditing where you can audit exactly who added a specific user
or group to domain admins and who took them out and you want to make sure you're auditing that and keeping it an
eye on it sorry I hit escape accident
okay on the topic of user accounts most
of us were all familiar with user accounts and we know that users have a logon name the problem with the logon
name is that it has to be unique within the domain and a lot of companies don't have very good standards to ensure
uniqueness I know companies who use first name last initial for example Dan H and that becomes
difficult because as soon as you have another Dan h1 user has to have a name that's not really their name so what I
encourage you to to the head towards is the old user logon name should be something that
is unique in the domain and unique for that user such as their employee ID or I
have some clients who actually allow users to pick their own user name like you would on Twitter or something like that and then you don't use that to log
on instead use the user principal name to log on the user principal name is another attribute of your user account
and it has to be unique within the forest but the advantage of user principal name is that it looks like and
it can be your email address so if I look at one of my employees accounts we
can see that their user logon name is Adam bar at contoso com which is also
his email address so that becomes very easy for users to remember they just log on with their email address and their
password and they think of it as their email address it just happens that the user principal name is the same as their
email address also consider renaming the administrator account that doesn't
technically add any security but it adds manageability too so that if someone is
accidentally logging on as administrator on their workstation but they forgot to choose the local machine and they're
still logging on to the domain they don't start creating audit trees in the domain so I do encourage you to rename the administrator couches
for manageability and then come passwords you have users within usernames and passwords and all of us
are used to this idea of you need an eight character password with complexity those eight character or six character
passwords with complexity aren't really that secure and the problem with complexity is that it becomes difficult
for users to remember and difficult for them to type and one of the biggest
risks for passwords is actually users having so much trouble remembering them
that they write them down right stick them on a post-it note under their keyboard or on their monitor instead encourage users to use phrases to use
sentences when you do the math a three word password is far more secure than a
6 character complex password so if my password is Antwerp is fun that's a very
very very secure password it's easy for me to remember and it's easy for me to type quickly so that if someone is you
know watching me it's tougher for them to see what I'm doing instead of me having to hold down ctrl or shift and
you know exclamation point so short phrases are actually more secure more
memorable and your users will appreciate it the other thing to think about is fine-grained password policies which are
a feature of Windows Server now relatively new that allow you to set more strict polyp policies for your
administrative accounts and your service accounts now moving into Active
Directory a little bit deeper one of the bad practices that I see is naming users
with their last name first just so that you can see them in Active Directory so
when you look at Active Directory users are sorted by name and they're sorted by the first letter in their name so if
you're looking for Bill Gates is he under B for Bill or W for William it's kind of difficult to figure out and so
what some companies will do is they'll do last name comma first name the problem with that and this is
illustrated on the slide is that when you when you look under the hood at what's going on what Active Directory
stores is actually their last name backslash , because the comma is a reserved
character in the distinguished name it separates the components of this distinguished name so if you have a
comma in the name it has to be escaped and that makes it tough to work with scripts and tough to work with other
things so instead of doing last name comma first name for the username we'll find another solution for that
which is to customize the MMC view so we can go into our views
let's take employees for example and we can simply add the last name column so
that when we need to sort by last name whoops I added the wrong column sorry
last name surname so when we want to
find a user by last name we can simply sort by that column to find them more effectively now it is okay to have the
display name be last comma first so the display name which it shows up in the
exchange global address list for example that's totally fine it's the common name
of the object which is how the object is listed here that you do not want to use last name comma first name now when we
added the last name column we actually exposed another problem with the toolset
which is when I added the last name column to the employees oh you it also adds the last name column to every other
view so now I see a last name column for my computer's which probably isn't very
helpful so we're gonna need to fix that as well but that's an option for us now the last
fifteen minutes of this session I want to start moving in two things you can do to actually administer active directly
directory more effectively and this takes us into a concept that I call extreme and then the C consoles so the
MMC console as I'm sure you know are the is the framework within which tools administrative tools snap in in Windows
so if you open an empty MMC console you can start adding snap ins and you can
say okay Active Directory users and computers I need group policy management I need let's say DFS management and you
can create your own tools now by doing this you can create a single console
that you can save and when you need to run your Administrative Tools you open that one console it has all the tools
you need and of course you need to open it with your administrative credentials so you do that one time instead of every
time you need to launch a tool having to enter a new set of a username and passwords for your administrative credentials just have one console with
all of your tools in it so it makes it easier to run as an administrator if you have all your tools in one place and
what we see here is a console that I built and you can see there are a lot of snap ins that I've added Active
Directory group policy several other Active Directory tools ADSI DNS
everything is here in one place so this is how I administer an environment like the Olympics for example so you add your
consoles in and then it allows you to log on one time as your administrative
account and that's much more secure and manageable for your environment and then
in the slides which you'll be able to download there are some pointers about how to work with these consoles more
effectively I'm not going to detail this right now just because of time but what
I do want to show you a couple of tricks in the console the first of which is the
link to web address snap in and out let me up the link to web address snap in is
designed to show you a web etre a website so if you go to add the snap in
we find link to web address click Add and we put in a URL and that will then
create a node in the console that shows a web page which might be helpful if we have documentation that we want to
incorporate into the MMC or an intranet site that we want to expose in the MMC but keep in mind that your MMC console
is running as an administrator so you don't necessarily want to be going out to BitTorrent downloading things from
this particular webpage because it will be running with your administrative credentials now one of the tricks that
is there that is not very well documented about this nappin is that you can add a UNC path so for example I can
I can create a path to backslash
backslash server a one backslash data to a share and what that does is it creates
a node that exposes the share in the MMC console now think about why this is
helpful if I am NOT in my console and I try to go to that share I'm connecting
to this share as my user account and my user account probably doesn't have permissions to do what I needed to do in
this share and Windows Explorer doesn't let you run a window and explore with different credentials you can only be
running one set of credentials in a Windows Explorer but the console is running as administrator as my
administrative account so now I can do things like set permissions and all of that within my administrative console
with this link to web address and happen so that's a really nice handy way to
work with being able to connect to a server as an administrator in addition
you want to start using saved queries now saved queries are a way of
virtualizing your complex environment so we already saw how complex this
environment is we have all these different OU's with the different computers we've got user accounts split
between contractors and employees and most Windows administrators are focused
on o use when they do administration and they constantly have to navigate down into their environment to find the right
account and it's tough to find things instead I encourage you to never use
your OU's instead create saved queries saved queries allow you to create a view
based on any criteria so for example I have a view of all computers in my
environment it doesn't matter which oh you they're in just all computers so I can quickly find
a computer by name without any to go deep into my oh you structure so save
queries allow you to create a view for example all users all computers all groups you can also use saved queries to
create reports so if my manager wants me to assess wants me to report users that
haven't logged logged on in 90 days I can actually create a saved query to do
that I can create a new query we'll call it users who haven't logged on in 90
days and then I can go define the query and I can pick 90 days since last logon
so you can create reports and then you can export these reports straight from
the MMC console with the export actually notice further down here we can create
other types of views that show us a subset of our environment so this is a
view that shows me administrative accounts this shows me a certain type of set of groups so I can create very nice
virtual views of my environment and then I can administer the objects from there
without having to worry about how complex my öyou structure actually is does that make sense
okay one of the other benefits of saved queries is that the columns that are
visible are per saved query so you remember I pointed out the problem with the last name column that then got added
to computers that doesn't happen and save queries and save queries I can have a different set of columns for computers
and a different set of columns for users so I can get very specific and give myself the information that I need in
order to administer my environment correctly so save queries have a lot of
benefits and the slide deck steps you through some of the things that I was just showing you now the final tip that
I want to give you related to working effectively as an administrator is how to bring it commands
you need into the tools that you use and let's start with in a really sort of
simple example which is as administrators we often want to Remote
Desktop to another machine that's very very common and we you know we can pull up the remote desktop console and we can
type in all kinds of information and we can connect it to another machine but it would be nice to be able to right-click
in Active Directory and say connect me to that machine we can do that as long
as we have a command that supports a variable so for example the MS TSC
command is the command that allows us to connect with remote desktop from the command line it takes a switch /v colon
and then the computer name it takes a variable knowing that we can create that
command in our console and let me show you how that works and what I'm going to show you is document it in the slide
deck so when you want to try this the instructions are all there what we do is we create what's called a task pad we
create a new task pad view so I'm gonna create a view we'll call it ends work
computers and then once you've created
the task pad view you get this area on the left that we can fill with tasks and
we'd fill those tasks by editing the task pad view and on the tasks tab creating a new task and the type of task
you want to create is called a shell command and again don't worry too much about the steps they are in the slides
and the shell command this is where the magic happens here the command and the parameters so
our command is M stsc dot exe our parameters are /v colon and then the
computer name and the way we insert the variable of the computer name is by clicking this button and choosing name
now windows does the rest it makes it it does this for us and you don't have to
worry about that that's hard-coded it's done automatically and now we've got the command the parameter
this variable of the name of the computer with that task we give it a
friendly name let's call it remote desktop we pick an icon and when we're
all done we can pick a computer and notice when I pick a computer my task
appears here and this task will run that command and the variable will be the name of that computer I'm not sure I
actually have remote desktop enabled on that server will cancel that but you can see that it's working now you take that
further and you can add all kinds of tasks to your console to give you things
that you need done so here's one that will show you as well opening the C Drive and opening a remote command
prompt it's common that you want to be able to connect to the C Drive of a machine when you're trying to support it
the way we add that task is we create
again a new shell command the command is going to be hopefully I can remember
this Explorer dot exe and then the parameters are backslash backslash the
computer name backslash c colon now I'm
doing this off the top of my head I might actually not have this perfect but we insert the variable into the command
that we want to execute oh shoot well since I messed that up let's look at the right one to be sure
see drive this is the 1i pre-created yep that was the right command so once we've
got that we again can pick a computer when we pick a computer the tasks we've
created light up and we can't open that computer see drive straight from Explorer and or straight from the MMC
and another good example is a remote command prompt now hopefully you've
heard of the tool PS exec PS exec is a great tool from mark russinovich who is
now back at Microsoft you can get it from tech tech net it's free and you can
use PS exact to run a command on a remote machine and we'll do a simple example of this which is and since we're
running short on time I'm just gonna show you the the preset PS exec dot exe
backslash backslash the computer name cmd.exe so this command will run PS exec
on the remote machine and we can then do anything we need on that machine so just to show you how that works I
click the task it opens up PS exec and PS exec is kind of like remote desktop
except it's remote command prompt so I'm now starting a command prompt that actually is running on that machine
contoso DC and assuming that it works here
I can prove to you that I'm on that machine by typing the command hostname and that shows me that I am in fact on
contoso DC so any command that you have that can accept a variable you can add
as a task so I've got things like ipconfig /all shutdown / restart MST SC
and gpupdate exe I've got all kinds of things that can take variables or that
can be used with PS exec that I can do to a single machine in my environment straight from within my toolset so
hopefully this helps you see that you can take tools that you've got and commands that you've learned and put
them right at your fingertips so that they're much easier to use and much more discoverable and you don't have to go
diving into your Start menu every time you need to administer your systems now the final thing I'll leave you with is
the idea that there are often tools that you need to load as an administrator
that are truly outside of the normal tool set there are things you need to run as an administrator like the command
prompt itself a lot of times you just need to open up a command prompt as an administrator let me show you a great way to do that within these MMC consoles
you can create you can add I should say a folder snap in which you can then
rename I'm just gonna call it ant work so I've just added this folder snap in
and I'm gonna create a task pad out of that folder and i'm gonna create what's
called a no list task pad which basically just gives me a big blank
window so that all i've done is create a task pad with nothing in it I'm now
going to edit that task pad and I'm going to add any command that I as an administrator want to be able to run as
an administrator so as a simple example CMD dot exe all by itself command prompt
and I can even go pick the icon CMD dot exe
so now I can launch this and because the console is already running as an
administrator anything I launched from the task pad will also be running as an administrator so we can see it is in
fact running as administrator so there's some great things you can do with the tools that Microsoft has given us that
they don't document particularly well that allow you to administer your environments much more effectively could
save queries with custom columns tasks pads that bring tools in and finally
there is of course PowerShell which opens up all kinds of additional capabilities for automating and PowerShell can also be brought into this
framework and you can be launching commits launching commands that in fact start a PowerShell session so for
example I can start an interactive power sell shell session on this computer so
hopefully this inspired you to start going looking outside the box with the
tools that that you have as an as a Windows administrator just as a quick reminder my email address my Twitter
handle I'm always here to answer questions for you the the tools that I've shown you I will put into a zip
file and post later on this week so they will be up there for you and I hope that you've really enjoyed students to
business 2011 thank you guys very much for coming and I look forward to following your success as Active
Directory administrators thank you very much [Applause]
