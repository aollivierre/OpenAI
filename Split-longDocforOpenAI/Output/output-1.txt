This is part number 1
Speaker 1 00:00 And here to add value to the businesses to move them from a tob. Example. Any disagreements on the choice support that any does that drive echo? Okay, perfect. So that's that's kind of the computing and that's what we we are. Now we have evolved over the years. This is here just a brief timeline. Of how the company has started. And where are we? Our are we at today? And where are we headed? So, And 2014. The company was incorporated. Officially When pretty much this is late, that here i graduated from the ROC polytech. From the electronic engineering program. In 2015. Spider in the company on a full-time basis. Prior to that i had a full-time job as an embedded system developer. With a local company here that it's called presentek the manufacturer systems for vehicles. To forget a logging, so it's It was a good job. It was a tough decision to to really make that. I just to switch full-time to the company, or yeah, it was A decision that i spend about 10 days contemplating on and i can certainly dive in details there if you guys are interested, but that's not obviously the goal of this meeting. And 2015. Also as a was a video for us, you know, it's uh we got a really good project with the RBC or the back of Canada and collaboration with IBM. And to basically migrate To three thousand computers. So, from Windows, XP to Windows 7, excellent project. Lots of hands-on, and Uh, really kicked off the the year and and the commitment there on a good note. Also, we have got a really A good project with mogul, financial institution. Uh, it's a local Canadian credit card company if you guys haven't heard of it, Before it's based on vancouver, they were establishing their second call center in in the And the country and they had it in one of like, so it's It was, i don't have still there. I those pumping, something they moved past, i wonder if they are still there. They are they weren't exchange district. So we helped them build the, the foundation, the low voltage, the switches the, then the entire network stack, Running. About 500 cables or so in the call center and was a really good project that's in 2015. And of course, You know, over the years here, i'm just mentioning the highlights the key highlights, but since we started, we are an IT company, you know, and prior to even 2014 slightly that's when we onboarded best western downtown benefit. And we help them in. Migrating their exchange server from SBS to to To 2008. We Speaker 2 02:49 Always have. Who is the second? The second full-time employer. Speaker 1 02:53 Excellent question. So Singapore, time employee was a gentleman named android and report. No, and he's working for microsoft right now. Uh, he was the very second person that we hired on a full-time basis and And really help the company you work with us for what a year and a half. And Uh, was excellent person. He graduated from the RFC politic from the BIT program and Did an excellent job in these very driven man. And And yeah, he's now working at Microsoft, he's in vancouver. Um, And yeah, so in 2016, we had Our first investor in the company. He showed it interests. They started were growing. They they Uh, they wanted to be part of what we are. What our first official office in 2017, that's when we established our relationship with microsoft. You guys know it's no doubt it's the bread and butter of what we do. It's a key partnership that we have in place and and we Are growing with it. We want to keep maintaining it. We want to keep our skills, sharp around it to continue excel. Excellent. In 2018, we had another major project. And that's a network upgrade for. Many, many hotels across the country, it's for the best western. So we've done network upgrade for about 100 plus hotels. From east to west pretty much, many of them we travel to And many of which we also are cloud contractors for and it was done in two stages. A stage one is to do an assessment. Understand what's existing take that information plantings out and then Lots of coordination with so many key players. And and then schedule the upgrade to take place. Usually, about a month or two after, Uh, so we participated in that. If you're interested to know more about any of these talk to me, i'm happy to expand and tell you and even show you some Some more information a lot, really lots of potential and that project A grew organically we want that project organically just from our relationships for the local Best Western. So we started with the very first Best Western in downtown United Bank 2013 from there. The order of mouth started to dry and we got other best western and then Best Western on Pembina. As some of you guys know, they are the governor, they are the governor for all the best Western in Manitoba. So they oversee any new best western, they do the inspection for them. And they played a key role in securing this relationship with the international. With the best western international organization in the states. Uh, Next here. And 2019. As you have no apologizing, the organization on a full-time basis. Um, We he helped in automating many of the financial aspects prior to that we were doing a lot of manual work when it comes to sending invoices and whatnot. Done, a really good job there in automating. Many of that. And, Let's see here. What else is the key points to mention? Yeah, in 2020. That's the covet year. We uh the company we are three talented people. Uh, who Some of them are still with us and, you know, some are not but It was a good year. New major point in healthcare. Uh, we got support from both of governments as well as establishing a specialization in the technical team, a little bit as, you know, we're small team. So i'm kind of point at some of us here. So as you guys know, you know, Trevor is holding the network area, this is a special team, right? It's no longer. Uh, just every Yeah, it's it's that sort of an henry of course is in charge of the support arm, we take chart, we we take Uh, and we help each other right in that we sometimes take turns on these roles. It's not meant to be for one, person only or or so. And the goal that vision is to grow that person to a team in the future as well until we are there, we have to continue to support each other as a small team here and And collaborate that were possible. 2021, we federal incorporated the company, we establish our advisory board, which we want to really Uh, get get back into. Activated a little more. We just have been so busy in the last few years that we have been able to do much. But yeah, establish a great team of advisor advisors Thank all your art is also. That's where we start the ownership with rod being on advisory board first. And there are a few key people there that we certainly would like to engage in and learn more from and update them on where we are at. We switch our accounting firm which we are also probably enemies switching one more time this year. Uh, they haven't been able to just catch up and just been a chaos to be honest, but that's just another That point a point for another discussion in 2022, we doubled in revenue as a company. We expanded to the smart park area. Where we are at today. And, Yeah, in 2023, our company and maybe some of you may or may not know, we became acidic advisor. We are registered with the government of canada as a As an advisor, the advisory company i am on that. Role and we'll try to open it up as it gets more traction but it is moving slow, to be honest, but we do become a C diff advisor. See that if you don't know what it stands for, Anyone know that everybody knows what sidades you know, giana probably right. You know this as well. Trevor Henry, i don't know, i don't know. Yeah. So it's it's basically starts what? Canadian digital adoption program. It's a program from the governor of canada that gives businesses. Uh, up to 15k in funding. To work on their digital adoption plan. So it's any small business in here. You think about they are interested in in maybe creating a plan to see where they're headed, they may very well qualify for this program and through that program they can see who is registered there and they can pick And they can work with that partner. Um, and what we do is creating a plan for them, looking at what they currently have their business objective and And try to see what technology could help them get to where they want. So basically the funding covers, the planning only, it doesn't cover the implementation. Uh, that's where they can be qualified to. Uh, that's where they can qualify to another funding from the bdc It's It's a, it's a basically, a Canadian bank owned by the government that gives them funding to To basically execute on that plan, they give them up to 100k. In and funding. But that's, that's a loan, basically, it's not a grant. So the the cdap gives up to 15k of grants, the bdc would give them up to 100 certain amount roughly Depending on their business size, but it does go up to 100k. And and that's alone you have to pay back. It's what's nice about it. It's an interest-free loan. Speaker 2 10:21 Yeah, Speaker 1 10:21 Up to five years and they can return. Okay, so they don't have to impact their cash flow to implement. That that plan. So Uh so yeah, lots from the government of course to get get good with technology. The people just have to know where it is and we have to know how to fit and and how to to plug ourselves. So we can also play value there. Our goal as you guys know last year and also this year is to do more with less as well, right? Is learning how to leverage our, our key people and our our key resources around us from tech and whatnot to really do more with less. It's Uh, we've been over the years, you know? It's always an investment growing, a business, always an investment. There's always that, you know, we have to Uh, you know, invest in an office, for example, and then hopefully it will get Utilized in the near future. We have to invest on a computer by computer as a person. And then slowly you'll start utilize it. And and then you have to invest in people bringing the right people. And then hopefully, slowly. They Can be more engaged, more. Uh, more so driving the business and driving the The commitment to our customers. So it's always an investment. But, you know, at some point you do have to Come and say okay, we'll be invested in something. Let's let's now try to make sure we are leveraging everything that we have invested in and let's make sure we are. Uh, truly building, not just spending our wheels or not, not just staying in location A or not. Moving to be And so on and so forth. And we have You came a long way since we started the company. I think lots of You know, all of this is just achievements, right? We went also be more. Uh, when it establish an internal. The transparency accountability, some of this you guys have seen through the time tracking through what we what we have been doing, which sending those reports on a weekly basis to everybody even engaging the investors and the people are interested. Uh With more transparency showing them. Okay. Where are we at from numbers perspective? And where are we headed? So that's that's a little bit of time like that. Maybe i'll pause for a moment here. Again this is really the goal of this is to engage in discuss. Uh, share interests. Any questions and comments? By losing anybody's. Attention. All good. Yeah, that's why i'm giving me the Thumbs up there. And i'm Speaker 3 13:02 Wondering if in this, like Presentation, i, we have the previous like achievements and stuff, but do we have like a road Speaker 2 13:07 Map for a future of like where we want to be in the next following year? And you know, Speaker 4 13:11 Very good, very good question, happy. Yeah. Speaker 1 13:13 All right, excellent. Uh, the last couple of slides, we'll talk a little bit about some of the things that we want to achieve or what we want to focus on. Uh, depending machine Jump. Yeah, so there are a few and the last few years like there are a few points but what excellent point? Yeah. That's Uh i'll try to scam to the next slide here quick so that we can hopefully get to them. And because circling the goal is to To. Yeah, the future is so that's that's you know we want to know what's the past. We want to know our ad today. What we certainly want to know what are we headed? Um, you guys know our mission statements to provide provide the highest level of hockey service to our value clients by carefully. Assisting specific needs. We always start with assessment knowing what they have. And and delivering customized solutions using the most advanced and appropriate systems available in the marketplace. And this is just a symbolic cloud. I put it there for some of the people who, you know, get to see the company, it just reflects that the company has evolved, you know, there were a few stages at the very first logo, we had the company is that and then we engaged some professionals to help us improve and then that's we ended up with that with the final logo. So there is a lot of gives you. Yeah. The company not just start yesterday or a year before. You know, there's been a bit of Of changes and and evolution there. Uh, we care the most in this company. As people as founders and as even staff and whatnot about the relationships, Between our staff. Our vendors, our partners. Our customers most importantly, Uh, these relationships are key to us. We every one of them, it took time a lot of time to build and establish that trust. So our goal is to really continue on building those long-term relationships. Uh, good relationships. And and yeah. So we have an industry leading client and staffing interest rate. It makes us the number one choice for for the Speaker 3 15:23 Customer Speaker 1 15:23 It needs. Uh it might it is something we want to continue nurturing for sure. Many of the companies that work like, you know, the surround computers, for example, and others, they come to they gotta gotta start to fire customers. How do you part of? Like, you know, it's it's we we took us time to build a connections. And relationships. How do you like you know many many of those bigger sort of opportunities they come and tell you all you have got a fire desk and done and that it's not it's not it's something you want to get better at perhaps, maybe at making sure the right people are around. But but it's something you know it's not easy for me to do and well thank Speaker 2 16:02 You're not if they're still cycle there. Like that makes sense. When you're, you know, Negative capacity, right? But yeah, you still have cycled. Why not keep it everybody happy, right? So and Again, they're trying to say, You know, in their world of greed. They're trying to keep everybody at a profit margin of this week. You might have a customer that you only make this app. Get rid of them. Yeah, Speaker 1 16:27 Wait Speaker 2 16:29 We can still help them. Speaker 1 16:30 Yeah, so Speaker 2 16:32 I agree with Speaker 1 16:33 You. That's yeah, the balance there is certainly something we need to learn how to do. And and yeah, there is a lesson learned there Speaker 2 16:42 For sure. And that's a it's that somehow you want to Keep a few really good customers rather than a bunch of. You know, at a whole bunch of bunch of headaches. Speaker 4 16:53 Yeah, headaches right, right, Speaker 1 16:54 Right. Speaker 3 16:57 Absolutely. I Speaker 1 16:59 I think it's Yeah. I i certainly need help in that. Absolutely because As you mentioned, we took us time to build these images. But how do you announce, say, well, listen, you know, it's i really appreciate this and all of that, but we're now Speaker 3 17:14 Then Speaker 1 17:15 Yeah, it's keep remembering where we came from and how we got there. Feel free guys. Whoever wants to be the hammers. Speaker 2 17:30 Oh, it definitely is a case by case base, it takes a lot of assessment, right? Speaker 5 17:34 Because you have to let go, there's nothing. Speaker 1 17:39 So you guys know what we offer so i'm not gonna maybe well it's worse, i guess refreshing so got services around workstations services around servers and some others around networks and cloud. You guys think this is it's still true should be adjusted do we should be welcome other services here or other categories? Is this? Digestible, when it's presented that way. Let's start taking your opinion quick since everybody, i will change workstations perhaps Speaker 3 18:10 And Speaker 2 18:11 Point or customer claim. Find what is this? Something like that Speaker 4 18:15 And points? Yeah, Speaker 1 18:16 We're taking notes, right? I am taking notes. Yes. At least call me. Speaker 2 18:22 Yeah. Speaker 1 18:22 But if i could ask about those measure changes like that. It's highlight them. So we really act on them because yes, and user compute and user computer. Okay, I love it, that's great. Will adjust that. The rest, you guys think it's, it's It's reflects what we do is there anything that? Is not shown there, but we actually work on. And we should have. Speaker 2 18:50 And licensing. Speaker 3 18:52 When Speaker 2 18:53 You think that, you know, there's how there's companies out there that have issues with Got too much strong. We don't know what it started. We had you know, we had We have three things that we buy that are doing the same thing. Can you is there some sort of licensing? You know, review of that right? And i don't know where we fitted Speaker 3 19:14 Them, right? And Speaker 5 19:15 It's good i think to put in microsoft too because as i've been searching before, like i Done in my searching on those. Different companies. I always need microsoft there. Okay. On their Solutions. Microsoft partner, efforts. So people will be affected to it, because everybody knows microsoft right? When you have sites for partners, right? We have like logos Speaker 1 19:43 I we have one in the in the proposal, right? Yeah. Speaker 2 19:46 We used to look like i removed it. Speaker 1 19:49 Oh, all right. I remember we used to have it right or not. I yeah was it not that relevant to investment or investors? I guess? Speaker 2 19:57 Yeah. Speaker 1 20:00 Bitcoin john logos. Um What if we speak with a customer? That's Apple. Significant with apple, right? How do you? Speaker 3 20:11 I'm not sure, Speaker 5 20:12 But i just i just see the SEO later. Speaker 1 20:15 Okay. Speaker 5 20:16 Search engine optimization, so i see. What other? Other companies are doing on their websites so Speaker 1 20:25 You can add apple, like apple logo. Speaker 2 20:33 Without architecture partnership or Speaker 1 20:36 Not apple. I just Speaker 2 20:37 Technology buckets, right? Yeah, Speaker 1 20:44 We can say microsoft's cross platform Speaker 2 20:46 But i think that's a better thing, right? Yeah. Speaker 3 20:48 Or like something like, uh, almost like user solutions. Like a lot of this. If they have, like a large corporation with a lot of employees, they're looking at this like, hey like what is the interaction day-to-day with actual people and what do you do for them? Because like, a lot of us is actually just really To people with issues, they have or like user life cycle, different access management, stuff like that. So something that's All encompassing for actual kind of people and what they'll see day-to-day like, that would be a good thing to throw in Speaker 1 21:15 There. And Speaker 2 21:15 I think along those things lines of what you're getting at is. So how do you process an automation, right? And that's when you say tech enabler, Having processor automation is such a buzzword everybody wants. Some degree of automation, they don't know what but that's that's one of Speaker 5 21:33 Those are keywords. So i'd Speaker 2 21:37 Just say where did the where do those fit into current buckets there. Right? Speaker 4 21:41 Automations good. You want to add here and Speaker 1 21:44 Do we do a lot of automation? Speaker 4 21:46 Well, depends where i like, i mean, i do automation, Speaker 1 21:49 Right? Speaker 4 21:49 Like, i mean, I think trevor's is doing automation Speaker 1 21:52 But Speaker 2 21:53 It's almost the that that assessment. Speaker 1 21:56 Yeah, like Speaker 4 21:56 Network wise, right? Speaker 2 21:58 So Speaker 1 21:59 Tell me more How are you automating? Like like i Speaker 4 22:03 Don't know. Log shipping logs, right? Okay, Speaker 1 22:05 I Speaker 4 22:06 Don't know. You're automating that Speaker 1 22:08 In a way, right? Like, you know, Like, Speaker 3 22:14 Backing up data, or Automating that okay, okay. Speaker 6 22:20 Automation. Would you? Speaker 2 22:23 You probably have it all over and you're just not even thinking like, oh yeah, Speaker 3 22:28 A lot of the solutions like that and stuff. I feel like um, They can all kind of dip into each of these in a certain way so i don't know. Like more maybe something that's like easily digestible with someone who you know wouldn't be able to name. Okay. What is a cloud solution? Speaker 5 22:43 Yeah. Speaker 4 22:44 Like when we push out apps, right, like policies. Like like, i mean, trevor can go in and push a policy out to all the firewalls, right? Right. Speaker 2 22:53 And i think, Thank you. Yeah. Speaker 1 22:57 All right now to all the power. Not at once again Speaker 3 23:00 But Speaker 2 23:01 If you have it but it aligned to it take a neighbor Speaker 1 23:03 Sure. Uh okay superficable, absolutely i love it. This is great. So maybe licensing and automation we talked about those two Uh, yeah, we'll add them Speaker 2 23:14 And licensing might be a very Minor one, the automation i think, is much bigger because Speaker 5 23:19 Exactly it Speaker 2 23:20 Really gives a Like let's face it, these are all things. Speaker 1 23:24 I Speaker 2 23:25 Put the most part about a company and gloated by. Hey, they can go buy their own microsoft Office, right? But hey wait, how do i need it all together? And some of that whether it's animation or implementation, Speaker 1 23:39 Solutions. Right. That's About the microsoft. I'll perhaps start to add that slide back again about the partners. And it's known secret that we, we cannot do this ourselves. We we with partners. Is how we establish and how we, how we get there. And certainly, we have strong partnerships with microsoft Fortinet And ether and few other key players that help us develop, and develop our services in these different categories that Uh, so so absolutely I think it's so into other that slide again. Okay this one here just gives everybody here a little bit about how we know we evolved we obviously from really the beginning. There we had a technique system in place. So we looked at how many tickets we resolved since the beginning as profitable 13 thousand plus. It's also, it gives you an idea how we grew and, you know, could say you could see that, uh, within constantly growing, it's not like You know, maybe a little bit of a depth here in 2021 but then it follows with it with really busy appeared in 2022. Uh, we did in 2023, i guess. Mainly because of the spikes that we had from FGC and a few other key customers. And then things have slowed down. A little bit and 2020, but You know, hopefully 2024 will Product seed, both. Uh, but yeah, so that's that's that. I Speaker 2 25:08 Like your. What is your your squiggly line underneath the 13 thousand tickets? That's what i'm usual. Oh yeah. Is it based on the bar? Right. Speaker 1 25:20 I i'm trying to talk about, you know what, this is a good question. That's Speaker 2 25:24 Unusual. Speaker 1 25:25 It's Speaker 2 25:25 Just yeah, but it's like what i oh yeah, i Speaker 1 25:30 Use the automation actually, in the park. Speaker 2 25:33 They're design. Tab. Okay, Speaker 1 25:38 Not copa is quite yet there but yeah, it suggested that i use this line so Speaker 2 25:43 Well. Speaker 1 25:45 Okay Speaker 2 25:46 So does it also a highlight here somewhere in the next slide? It shows that henry close six thousand of those. Speaker 1 25:53 Oh yeah, yeah. So look at this. Here they are. Speaker 2 25:58 Alex Speaker 1 25:59 This next slide. Indeed have a little more. Speaker 2 26:01 I got one. Yeah, Speaker 1 26:02 I Speaker 2 26:03 Got one, right. Speaker 1 26:07 That's cool. So Yeah, this one here gives Speaker 2 26:11 Us. Speaker 1 26:12 Rod Speaker 2 26:14 Was that the end request. A requested. Uh yeah i sold that that level three potion and which was Speaker 1 26:21 Everquest the game that we're talking about. Yeah. So suffix boundary to Islamp q. Just showing the other response time in the team and then the average resolution time for ticket. I'm sure the key people in the company who's, you know, really working in the team and If you want to, Ask any questions about any. So let's just give you a slide. About that. Let's see here call to highlight that the busiest hours of the year. Is usually between nine and five or nine of four? No, no, no, no, no. It's obvious why i guess. Uh, so like one one pm looks like to be the busiest, you know, it could sort of read different kind of data from here depending on how you like to just see it one day, for example, is the busiest day of the year. So this is really that's an average right from the 2023 years. Another slide just tells you briefly what the company is busy with most of the time apple, lots of apple one apple, one micro 365 services red and butter and we have yeah. Okay i like yeah i guess you you can always decide you want to be at the top 10 percent. You could be a tough to percent of the bottom or the highest Speaker 2 27:43 Exactly. That you're leading the leading, the worst. Yeah. Speaker 1 27:48 Yeah. But uh, that's actually cool to look at. Okay. What are the lowest services that we do? But yeah. So 361 networks are the the major To service categories here. Uh, printers are still a fair amount of work there. Uh, let's see here. I'd like to tell people that were exceptional. We our team of amazing technologists that we are here to help grow and learn and, you know, keep things moving forward. Absolutely Speaker 2 28:19 Electrician. Speaker 4 28:21 Uh, Speaker 2 28:22 I know you're using the sounding thing about it. I'm thinking like central gas or something. Yeah, sniffing, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Not sniffing the networks. Yes, sniffing something else. Yeah, Speaker 1 28:36 We need your picture Henry here. And john, right. I don't know if you like to have architecture your picture. Yeah, i would love to So from time to time, we would come just like what where we are today for weekend, lunch and learn. We love to do, more of them, not easy to organize, what Just to keep our knowledge in check and and synchronize what we know as a team. Um, As a team. As a company, we share a number of core values. It was brings us together what we value. Those the most and we value so many others as well. Uh, i want to take perhaps a moment with new team to To China with these briefly and see if perhaps there are, maybe one or two. We could add as a result of of the today's meeting. Uh, you know, traveling probably guys, remember when we very first established, this we sat down together, we tried to brainstorm what makes sense, and as a core value for our company, and And yeah, so we no doubt. I have a high level of integrity as a team. I have a an extreme level of honesty. I wouldn't, i want to say and i would love to I hope to continue to certainly keep all of these. Uh and check we have a good level of humility balance with competency always, you know, when you bring humility to the table, you want to make sure your ring competent people to the table. Uh, but they're not sort of people who are bragging or, or arrogant sort of speak. There are people who have a good level of competency but they, they can share that and talk about it in a, in an approachable. Good way to to other people. I want to drive excellence. We want to continue to always drive, excellence drive, excellent, the value to our customers. The moment we seize to offer value or add value that's when we seem to exist. That's when the relationship will automatically start to just sort of die. So we want to continue maintaining these strong core values as a team. And, and certainly, we want to There are so many more that could be added for sure. But i would love to as a, as a result of our today's meeting. To certainly add one or two more, at least. So Let's open it up your team. Let's, let's take. Your ideas, your thoughts about, About. If you're really feedback for us on these, if they should be changed and then maybe at least one or two that we could add. Forever. Speaker 3 31:06 Yeah, i'm just curious about what you mean about like the the value. I don't think we have that one when we did it Speaker 2 31:12 Initially. Like, do you mean like individual value? Speaker 3 31:15 Like as Person brings your own value or Speaker 2 31:18 I guess value. Here is the appreciate this because if it's Speaker 1 31:22 Not confusing, then it may not be very clear to many people as well. So it looks like me try to work on that but the goal of this is Adding value to customers, right? So capital as part of our core value as a team we always continuously one up add value to the table. Right? When we are at a problem when a problem is presented to us when a meeting where i'm eating as a company, as a team, as people. We are not going to come here for just. These egg of looking at each other replaces, or we're gonna come here to add value right? When the customer and buys us to that table, we will for sure add that Speaker 2 31:57 Right. I want to ask Jonah. What do you, maybe? That wouldn't value. Speaker 5 32:09 Giving value to the company also and giving value Speaker 2 32:13 To the customers as well. Do you like the word? Speaker 1 32:18 Yeah, but definitely what you think. Speaker 2 32:21 If you think like in a, i'm kind of wondering if we because i don't get to the A good value here mean. Like i know where we're trying to strive for is that we're seeing as being Value Speaker 5 32:35 Valuable to Speaker 2 32:37 A customer and that there is You know, legitimate reasons to keep the relationship. But i look at and go think about it, you know, almost out of your question goes. Value. We change the word, bargain. Was that is that something we want to maybe pull out bargain? Cheaper something like that. Dude, we want to kind of just say okay great that the rest of this comes with that. Speaker 3 33:05 I didn't look at it that way but i could see how someone could make that assumption maybe. Yeah. Speaker 5 33:10 That Speaker 3 33:10 We're trying to prove something that you know but Speaker 1 33:13 I Speaker 3 33:14 Don't know. I mean, i look at it as we're, you know, returning on their investment of having the relationship with us and like any issue will be resolved to ensure that they're Speaker 2 33:23 That they're kind of 100% Speaker 3 33:25 Capacity for running with business. Yeah, Speaker 2 33:27 That's, that's great. Speaker 3 33:28 I mean, you could find another synonym that maybe. Speaker 1 33:32 Let's, Let's take a quick watch. Should we remove this? Or is it ambiguous, or should we keep it or should we change it to as anonymous world? What Speaker 2 33:42 Else would we add? Let's try that, Speaker 1 33:44 What else? Yeah. Speaker 2 33:45 Okay, Speaker 1 33:45 Let's let's keep a brainstorming, uh, session quick here on this starting off confidence, whatever comes to mind, Speaker 2 33:53 Confident confident, Speaker 5 33:56 Um, dependable. Speaker 1 33:57 Dependable. Speaker 2 33:59 Yeah, yeah. Speaker 3 34:00 Really reliability. Depend up there with. Speaker 1 34:05 Okay, let's let's keep it coming and we'll choose i'm sure too function. Speaker 2 34:10 Okay? Uh, He wakes it on because i don't believe in that. Speaker 1 34:16 Innovation. Speaker 5 34:17 What can we put Speaker 2 34:18 Innovative? Yeah, Speaker 5 34:20 Yeah. Speaker 1 34:23 Okay. Let's see. Yeah. One from On your side there on on Speaker 4 34:30 Mine's side. That's a good. Speaker 1 34:32 I think you mentioned one time about you mentioned one that you wanted to add always he said mission i would love to Speaker 2 34:39 Oh Speaker 4 34:39 Yeah, yeah, absolutely. A tenacious Speaker 2 34:42 Diligent. Yeah. Speaker 4 34:44 Curiosity or curious? Speaker 2 34:47 Yeah. The, Speaker 4 34:48 The one core value that is undermine core value that we never mentioned curious. Speaker 1 35:00 Okay. I don't know what's calling everybody. Speaker 2 35:05 With the laptop version. Speaker 1 35:06 Yeah. Okay. Now that's great. Well actually those are really good ones. Yeah. One last anyone wants one comes to mind wants to end. And we'll try to vote for maybe one or two because we don't want to make Speaker 3 35:20 It. So proud of our saturated. Speaker 1 35:22 I got an advice one time. No let's have four or five he said even three but i said okay. Well I don't know creature, but we came with five Speaker 2 35:30 Did that maybe Speaker 3 35:31 Spies is good? Speaker 2 35:33 Yeah, Speaker 1 35:34 Yeah. Life is good. Speaker 3 35:35 I think we could replace value with replacements. Speaker 2 35:37 I think i think humid, humility could probably be swapped for something here too. Speaker 1 35:42 Okay. And Speaker 2 35:43 I think maybe let's remove punctual. It's probably not a good word. Okay. Speaker 1 35:47 So Speaker 2 35:48 There's better words right? Better better. Speaker 1 35:51 Sure. I Speaker 2 35:52 Like innovative, i like Speaker 3 35:54 Innovative q. I like curiosity is well. Speaker 1 35:58 Okay so that's good. Speaker 2 36:00 Resilient Religions or something resourceful. Statistics Speaker 1 36:08 Or Speaker 2 36:08 Stubborn. Speaker 1 36:09 Stubborn. Speaker 2 36:18 A lot of persistent like a next level research. Speaker 1 36:23 Okay, Speaker 2 36:24 Instead of a cure, Confidence. We put arrogance. Speaker 1 36:30 Yeah. Speaker 2 36:36 Ignorance. There we Speaker 1 36:37 Go. You want me to replace it? It was a replace. Speaker 2 36:40 I like it. That's even that's maybe so we can cross that line up, so sure. Speaker 1 36:49 This one here. Speaker 2 36:51 Yeah. Speaker 1 36:51 All right. So let's let's select then. But you're taking notes, we're going to replace value with something. And then humility looks like we should is there something, okay? Technology. Maybe. It's not the necessary, the best word but it is conveying a message to whoever is reading. Okay, well, there's something. Uh, in it i like to say I like to say that our team has this in in natural, it's nature to some of us and it is something that i'm Feeling that it is. What's making us sometimes win relationships. Maybe not. Not exactly like the maybe there is a better word but i i wonder. Right. Why did you want to ask to remove this? Because it's a good never Speaker 2 37:36 Humility. Yeah, Speaker 1 37:37 You said Speaker 2 37:38 I I look at it as Um, what i think, humility and i love that, i love because i think it does represent. The main ways. But i also look at it as a head down. You know, we're not. It's almost It's almost the opposite of competent. Right. You know what i mean? Speaker 1 37:58 Yeah Speaker 3 37:58 And it's kind of like have a negative Speaker 5 38:01 How about accountability, but Speaker 2 38:03 I like the yeah. Speaker 3 38:08 Ingenuity. It's like across between innovation. Speaker 2 38:10 Yeah, yeah. And i actually like dependable. Speaker 1 38:16 Let's say henry Speaker 3 38:17 That's an ingenuity. Speaker 5 38:18 It's Speaker 3 38:20 A combination of being like innovative. I think creatively, advised original solutions. Okay, so Speaker 1 38:30 I see that. Foreign product indeed and i was always wondering about. Yeah that Speaker 2 38:36 So okay so i would say first we looked at integrity And again, take her any psych, a lot of other things but it might be that Honesty. As good as a word is. Combining say integrity with a word like dependable, almost implies. Honestly, that makes Speaker 5 38:57 Sense. That's true. Speaker 2 38:59 Or dependability or something on something like dependable and With. And humility was just, can we tweak it to? More competence raised or more but i really like ingenuity Speaker 1 39:19 Because Speaker 2 39:20 It incorporates like like Henry nailed it. I think it just Speaker 1 39:24 Two people and how do you count for that second? Okay. So, Speaker 2 39:32 I think it was a third here. Speaker 1 39:33 Okay. Speaker 5 39:38 As the best one. Speaker 1 39:39 So what we said, we have gonna remove interest or taking this Notes and then values. Thank Speaker 2 39:49 You. Yeah, Speaker 1 39:50 And you said honesty is moved out and replace it with because you're saying integrity and And the Speaker 5 39:59 Pain. Speaker 2 39:59 Okay. A reliable dependable or reliable, or something. Speaker 3 40:06 Very close, right. Humility you use. Modesty. Yeah, that's a that's Speaker 2 40:12 A good tragedy. It's like limitless. Just a picture. Yeah. These. And, Well, maybe is there other ones we can strike know? Persistence. Do we like it? Speaker 3 40:38 I like it. I think we can describe it in other ways. Yeah, Speaker 5 40:41 I Speaker 2 40:41 Think Speaker 5 40:41 I don't Speaker 2 40:42 It's Like, i think it's in there with Like dependability or reliability something? Speaker 5 40:49 Yeah. I think reliability and a good word. Speaker 1 40:56 Reliabilities Speaker 5 40:57 The liability. Speaker 1 40:58 Okay, Speaker 2 40:59 Yeah. They're very they're very close, right? Yeah. Speaker 5 41:02 The end of a booty and persistent gravity. More coffee. Speaker 1 41:09 But we'll take a break at 1 30 for sure, for like, a So launches actually, pizza and donna? Cook Speaker 5 41:17 Something possible. Oh nice. Speaker 1 41:20 Wow. Speaker 3 41:21 Oh asleep. You know, those cars? Speaker 1 41:24 Yeah. Yeah, maybe watch out on that for sure. Um, Dependability. Speaker 7 41:32 Sorry, we were talking about persistence, right? Speaker 1 41:36 Yeah. Actually a good idea, probably, to take a straight stretching, break. Sure some Speaker 4 41:43 Oxygen, some o2? Yeah. Just Speaker 1 41:45 A minute or two. And well, what? Continue on this exercise? Speaker 5 41:48 A few would be compassion compassion, Speaker 1 41:52 Okay? Speaker 3 41:53 Right. Speaker 5 41:56 We do have a compassion Speaker 1 41:58 People. We had compassion, i think. Speaker 3 42:01 When's the last time you guys had changed the core value. Probably, Speaker 1 42:05 I think we came with us in 2020. Speaker 3 42:07 Yes, they've been the same since I've been Speaker 2 42:09 Like it was a little later than that. Speaker 1 42:11 A little learning Speaker 3 42:12 Franklin. I remember probably two years ago i would say Speaker 1 42:15 I'm kind of actually pull up my one north and i read you. I'll have Uh, i'll have all the ones that we even talked about. Uh, let's see here. Let's go. Open, you know. That Speaker 2 42:54 I didn't mean to quite. Oh no, no, that's washed any momentum here. Speaker 1 42:57 No, i thought it's a good. Uh, Idea to just take a quick stretching break for everybody. Speaker 2 43:03 How long Speaker 1 43:04 But maybe a minute or two? I Speaker 5 43:06 Mean i Speaker 2 43:08 Want to smoke. Speaker 1 43:09 Okay. Yeah. Just Speaker 2 43:13 Hide under the table. Speaker 1 43:15 Yeah, just Speaker 5 43:20 I have to go down. So however, later Speaker 1 43:23 That's what? Okay. Maybe Speaker 5 43:39 I'll go through the washroom. Speaker 1 50:20 Give me. Words yourself conference is important to have us. Do that over. I Speaker 3 51:05 Like it, Speaker 1 51:06 So it's I'll even write it down. Speaker 2 51:12 You should have seen my mood, gently coffee over there. Oh, he's a barista. Okay. Speaker 3 51:21 One of the psychology is between the color of this room, i was just thinking about it to keep you Speaker 2 51:26 Away. Yeah, Speaker 5 51:27 All the yeah Speaker 2 51:28 Probably anger, sprite. Great bright, green, new growth cleanliness. It's probably for a reason, right? The green should actually soothing pink in here. I'm Speaker 1 51:40 Not sure, yeah, actually, i always wondered because it's it didn't make sense. They got a deal on it, it Speaker 3 51:46 Definitely did he Speaker 2 51:47 Following your energy or something? Yeah, i think you're right. That's, i never thought about this way, but did you guys see what i did with the, the smart park lenders over there? We don't know. So you can see from the little when you come in doesn't say smart park anymore. Speaker 1 52:07 So actually, while we were Just before we went on a break. It's over reminded me that the session we had last time. What similar exercise was back in 2022. Speaker 2 52:19 April 11 2022. I know you and i have gone through these before because these decks were handy. When you were meeting in a customer service, we Speaker 1 52:30 Probably wasn't for the CRM proposal, perhaps we were having, Speaker 2 52:33 You had three things and expanded a bit Speaker 1 52:36 That Speaker 3 52:37 Was just before my time just Speaker 1 52:39 A little bit before your time henry and You actually had a good. Some of the ones that we talked about, actually, when we had the session, just me and Trevor and a blah. Where integrating honest, you talk about that. We talk about compassion we we have the understand the ability to understand specific people It happens when expecting people to be either caregivers or recipients at different times. We talk about considerate, we talk about visionary. We talked about prompt humble. And, Speaker 2 53:12 Let's see, we talked about a few others as well. I remember i was talking about Confidentiality and trying to get out across. We kind of said, well, integrity Speaker 5 53:21 Integrity. Yeah, Speaker 2 53:22 Of sums add up, right? Speaker 1 53:24 Confidentiality. Okay, well, Speaker 2 53:30 You know, just capture those and then maybe that's a yeah. Speaker 1 53:35 Okay, well sleep on them i guess and then see what What can come out of it? Yeah, we'll move forward in your team. And just because you didn't hear it at 130, we're going to take our lunch break, okay? So it happened hour food should be here a Speaker 2 53:54 Little bit after that, but Speaker 1 53:55 Sound great. Yeah. All right, i could. Go through them here. So we get the most calories. Okay, so Uh, team core values document that we're gonna digest. What you guys talk about here. Thank you very much. It is valuable feedback. I will see what these. How we can fit the? The discussion here into what we had. Before. Uh, this is here, you know, it's always helpful when especially, we're talking when you Investor or somebody who wants to look at the company or understand? Who is here. We want to tell them. It's not just me. It's not just a dollar. Who saw who they see? This is There's a fair amount of people who built and who got us to where we are as a team as a company and and this is just a really again another symbolic slide here to tell you who is around. There may be other people who i may have best, but this is just who we interact with. On a periodic basis, whether it is already today or monthly, or maybe annually, Uh, this is what you see here. So you see the core team, the the full-time staff, who make sure the this company is really standing on on solid foundation. You've got myself and abdullah as well. Who we constantly Are here to nurture develop and keep things moving. You've got. A number of great advisors in the company. Uh, you may have seen some and some you may not have seen.

And forgive me, john at a slight may be slightly outdated so i apologize. Your name is not there. Uh, but i do have to apply. If you could just make another as well, your name. God, the accountant. The lawyer. Of the company. And yeah, you've got a co-founder who started with the company as well in case if you guys don't know Muhammad al noury. He is a German who studied here at the university of Manitoba. That's how i met him. I he did his underground mechanical engineering and master and mechanical worked for a great company called slb and they transferred him from Canada, he was to work in the northwestern territories. Arabia his work, where he's working with the same company. Now really doing great, but he's not as in touch with the company unfortunately. For the last five years or so. As a matter of fact, Hey, one of the people who is looking to really exit completely, just because of the the geographical and the time zone different. So We've got Madison who invested in the company in 2016. Uh, i really not another great gentleman who works at cisco. He manages He's the original manager for Cisco in the Middle East. 13, 14 plus years of experience with Cisco. Everybody knows what cisco is. So yeah. And yeah.

Are you refrained? Muhammad ullah. Speaker 2 57:18 No, i thought there was a like, a third, no, i thought there was a third. There were never imagined. Speaker 1 57:22 That's the team Speaker 4 57:24 Myself. And the well, let me guess so, Speaker 2 57:27 My mood is we're operations. Speaker 1 57:31 Uh so just a couple slides.to who are the people you guys know us. So i don't need to Say much. In here. How much works SLB largest organ gas company in the world pretty much He played a positive role at the beginning. He has a strong finance background, he really helped the company at the beginning, in financial management and also he's been on the ground multiple times. Um, God, Trevor and henry or the staff in the company. Really keep the lights on and Make sure customers are happy. Company financials. All right, let's get to some density here team. So i again this the goal of this meeting is to collaborate. Create a level of transparency and also get your feedback and input. And you cannot see the full picture. If you don't see the financials, you cannot understand what you're working with. If you don't see this. There weren't occasions when there weren't there were never an occasion where, you know, i thought i should share or let you guys know. About it, there were never questions, but i, i thought, you know, it will help us well, formulating, a good good idea. Obvious, it's mandatory when we talk about investors and owners. It's mandatory for us. It's what they want to see. Uh, so The company financials over the the last years has been steadily. Increase in terms of revenue. So we have been our sales have an increasing Uh and you know, our our expenses, i've been also increasing as a result. And so this here, this slide gives you a really good idea of of the of the company's growth, right? So you've got in 2020 2021. Under 300k in revenue. And 2021 20 22 a little over 500 and then 2022-20 23. Uh, a little bit less than 700. And then now, last year has dropped a little bit. Um, You guys are inside the company so you probably could quickly explain the drop in the last year. You know, based on on a few elements that you are well aware of But that gives you a really good idea. Now, this doesn't tell you the full picture because this is only your revenue. It's not telling you expenses, nothing in your profit, not telling you much this next slide is where the real dense data. Is is located. And, And you know what? Uh, Don't. Uh, basically don't make the slide scare you. Okay? So and don't misunderstand for it. It's there, it's the facts. You know, it's so Let's talk about an event here. Revenue, we talked about it, show you in the previous slide where we were at. And our tall cogs. If you're not remember the term clouds, anybody knows what causes i'm sure rod. Probably knows but maybe others just curious cost of something cost of something indeed? Yeah Trevory You, you're surprised me with your financials because the other they were telling me grass profit and net profit. Like, oh, Okay. You know, that's right. No, Speaker 2 1:00:55 I don't. I i'm gonna guess. Good concern services. Speaker 1 1:00:59 Uh so uh Exactly cost of goods and service. Sorry, no, cost of good soul. Speaker 2 1:01:04 Okay, Speaker 1 1:01:05 Okay, so cards stands for cost of goods sold. Uh, it's just a very common term that you would see in a financial statements. If you are looking at a company to invest in or even buy stocks, if you look at their statements you'll quickly see the total cogs. So that's how much they bought. Uh, stinks that they sell sold so, so we bought this much in in 2021 2022. Last year, we bought 277 thousand dollars. Goods that we sold and those goods and that we sold our cover, that not probably in this in these slides here but think about them. What are they team? Speaker 3 1:01:43 What do you think like hardware hardware Speaker 9 1:01:46 Software life? Speaker 1 1:01:47 That's how much we bought. Um, sorry question. Um, Speaker 3 1:01:52 So, Cost of goods sold. So, um, is that just the total price of the, you know, the object or whatever it is, right? That doesn't include, that's not like profit. That's just the problem. Okay, Speaker 1 1:02:04 That's how much it costed us. Speaker 2 1:02:06 Yeah, so Speaker 1 1:02:06 That's why you see the next element. Here goes gross profit. So, right. Right away. When you do revenue, minus total cost. That gives you the gross profit now. Gross profit does not account for. The operation cost and any general? A company. When you read, okay, tutorial, we made gross profit 192k amazing. This is a very popular company. The thing that's not covered here is the operational cost. And that's what the next element. Tells you that all cost of operations which is, you know, rent office salaries. Insurance advisory you name it? Lawyers accountants. Software that the company subscribing to to maintain itself. Uh, all of that is covered in the operating expenses. This here, really tells you It's amazing. Good job, guys. You lower your operating expense last year. You're starting to show a little bit of a Better net profit than what you used to. So that's what you could read from this, you know, a little bit of positivity here. We've done a good job. I guess last year trying to cut down on unnecessary costs, you have seen some of that. And we want to continue on doing the same. We want to continue on driving net profit to be further ahead by not only cutting down on cost and optimizing what we have but also increasing sales, right? We want to continue to increase revenue. Bring new customers, we want to continue to work on that bottom line, that's what sometimes customers or companies refer to as the bottom line. So that's that's a huge vector for our company from a financial perspective. Not even because we like to see profit but also we want to It's extremely important. We will we can collapse as a company if we continue to to be on the negative side. So So, we want Uh, if i could If i could make an ask based on this, slide from everyone who's in one of the company esteem help us. Reduced. Expenses. And dry revenue. Drive revenue by sales and then there's so many different ways and reduce expenses and i'm not talking about, you know, a dollar or two. Of course, these are important door and to the add-off. But i'm talking about significant expenses. Um, You always want to look at. Saving a hundred dollar and how much it would cost you to save that hundred dollar versus Saving ten thousand dollars and how much that will cost. You one is one example would be is, you know, the maybe within like that example so much. But the slash, for example. Okay, let's cut down, let's remove slack, so it's extra expenses. How much flag is costing us, maybe 89 bucks or 100 bucks a month. How much would it take as an effort to move away from slot, right? And a fair amount of maybe getting used to do, we care about the data, do we not the value versus how much right as you're saving? So so to me, i wouldn't prioritize. Canceling slack. Because, Again, i'm paying just 100 bucks, it's retaining a fair amount of value. Uh, but just I meant to mention a small example. Yeah, that's a good example of Of how, you know, it's an expense but From the big scheme of things is that where we should put our time on or i put it on maybe driving more sales, be more strategic to be more more 100% with limited resources. This next slide here gives you the health roughly of the last year. So, you know, it's it's up to date. And tell december. Uh, 10th or so. So the orange represents expenses, the green represents income And, Uh you could see here, it's just really all over the places, you know, some months are high, some months are a little bit lower. Um, It just, you could. I guess what you could understand from this slide here is that there is always a minimum, right? Every month, the green here, tells you roughly, it's between about 25k or so, and that's really the recurring income that we're making from customers, right? So that's it's, it's in every month, it's not really dropping lower than 25k. And actually the next slide, we'll tell you a little more about what is the monthly income that the company is making from customers. Speaker 4 1:06:34 So, Speaker 1 1:06:34 Our customers on recurring, Uh, monthly spending. With us. We have some who are on a month
