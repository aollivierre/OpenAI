This is part number 3

-UseWebLogin Windows only: Connects to SharePoint using legacy cookie based authentication. Notice this type of authentication is limited in its functionality. We will for instance not be able to acquire an access token for the Graph, and as a result none of the Graph related cmdlets will work. Also some of the functionality of the provisioning engine (Get-PnPSiteTemplate, Get-PnPTenantTemplate, Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate, Invoke-PnPTenantTemplate) will not work because of this reason. The cookies will in general expire within a few days and if you use -UseWebLogin within that time popup window will appear that will disappear immediately, this is expected. Use -ForceAuthentication to reset the authentication cookies and force a new login. Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: Web Login for Multi Factor Authentication Aliases:

Required: True Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-Interactive Connects to the Azure AD using interactive login, allowing you to authenticate using multi-factor authentication. This parameter has preference over `-UseWebLogin`. Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: Interactive for Multi Factor Authentication Aliases:

Required: True Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-ForceAuthentication Will clear the stored authentication information when using -UseWebLogin (Windows Only) or -Interactive (all platforms) and allows you to authenticate again towards a site with different credentials. Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: Web Login for Multi Factor Authentication, Interactive for Multi Factor Authentication Aliases:

Required: False Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-ManagedIdentity Connects using an Azure Managed Identity. For use with Azure Functions, Azure Automation Runbooks (if configured to use a managed identity) or Azure Cloud Shell only. This method will acquire a token using the built-in endpoints in the Azure Cloud Shell, Azure Automation Runbooks and Azure Functions. Read up on the documentation on how to make use of this option. Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: System Assigned Managed Identity, User Assigned Managed Identity by Client Id, User Assigned Managed Identity by Principal Id, User Assigned Managed Identity by Azure Resource Id Aliases:

Required: True Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-UserAssignedManagedIdentityObjectId Can be used in combination with -ManagedIdentity to specify the object/principal id of the user assigned managed identity to use. Type: String Parameter Sets: User Assigned Managed Identity by Principal Id Aliases: UserAssignedManagedIdentityPrincipalId

Required: False Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-UserAssignedManagedIdentityClientId Can be used in combination with -ManagedIdentity to specify the client id of the user assigned managed identity to use. Type: String Parameter Sets: User Assigned Managed Identity by Client Id Aliases:

Required: False Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-UserAssignedManagedIdentityAzureResourceId Can be used in combination with -ManagedIdentity to specify the Azure Resource ID of the user assigned managed identity to use. Type: String Parameter Sets: User Assigned Managed Identity by Azure Resource Id Aliases:

Required: False Position: Named Default value: False Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-CertificateBase64Encoded Specify a base64 encoded string as representing the private certificate. Type: String Parameter Sets: App-Only with Azure Active Directory Aliases:

Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-Verbose When provided, additional debug statements will be shown while going through setting up a connection. Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: (All)

Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False

-EnvironmentVariable Connects using the necessary environment variables. For more information the required environment variables, please refer to this article, Azure.Identity Environment Variables here. We support only Service principal with certificate and Username with password mode for authentication. Configuration will be attempted in that order. For example, if values for a certificate and username+password are both present, the client certificate method will be used. By default, it will use the -ClientId specified in AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable. If that value is empty, it will fallback to the PnP Management Shell Azure AD App. Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: Environment Variable

Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False
