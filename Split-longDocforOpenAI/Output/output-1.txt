This is part number 1
Alright so I'd like to respond back to Monique era first of all I want to thank you so much I would like for sub out there also thank thank thank you and Ramon Ramon on your sort of dedication and commitment to this project and I really appreciate all your hard work and and you know your your input and guidance has been have been absolutely instrumental in this in this project and so so yeah I really I really appreciate all of your input and I just look I just want to clarify something here that the right now as as as as as I mentioned you know we have eight computers that are pending into enrollment so and so I I just want to clarify so what's what's what's happening here so so those computers are showing as the reason we we picked on this we picked it because those eight computers are showing so there's a number of factors that we number of numbers sort of variables that we factored in with our selection criteria here why why these 8 remaining we want to go after these 8 remaining right because obviously we have done some some we have we have sort of cross a major milestones so far in device cleanup switch clean up a lot of stale devices there and so the reason those are 8 remaining there's kind of want to focus on these last eight here of computers that are not enrolled in Microsoft intune is because of number of reasons little factors multiple variables here so the first thing is the fact that these computers are are active showed as active within the last 90 days on the domain controller OK so I just verified that and indeed all these eight computers actually do exist in the domain controller now it could be possibly that maybe at some point these computers maybe were renamed and in the old computer object was was sort of left behind in controllers if you guys think if so or not if you guys were obviously based based on on ramone Ramones input there we can go ahead and certainly sort of D this table the activator disabled these these computers are there computer objects that are no longer and and that's that's that's great that's great news that means it brings our our list of appending computers down by you know by factor of no by I don't know bye bye how many bye baby bye bye ten 2030% so that's good that means we did we have we have less computers to worry about so if rim on if Ramon you know based on Ramon suggestions and based on remote input and I really appreciate your input on this remote as well so I mean you're saying we don't have laptop named cpha to 2023NB004 so so based on that I can go ahead and mark this computer as I could treat this computer as a stale computer and an sort of disabling deactivated isolated and disabled with the other computers and that means we have less computers to worry about and that is absolutely great news that really appreciate your input on this remote and I think this is the the fruit of this collaboration is be able to find what is truly remaining right and that's against go back to our discussion for stale computers right and the importance of of in maintaining maintaining a clean Active Directory right so if we don't have such a computer like if there is no such computer physically exist if there is obviously no actual individual or user associated with this computer then we can safely go ahead and mark this treat this computer as tail and then obviously with that we can action it and go ahead and market you know disable that that computer object and move it to the isolated and so so again the reasoning again to answer your question Monique the reasoning I went with with with III have those names remaining because again those this report might be skewed and obviously we just found out that it is truly indeed skewed by by by stale computer objects right remember how many times we talked about the importance of cleaning keeping a clean Active Directory for efficiency for an effort to streamline and you know our efforts right to the so now we're wasting wasting cycles on stale stale computers and here we are of course exactly as you see we're having discussions back and forth about computers that don't even exist anymore and so again brings me back to the important discussion of having a clean after directory but I do want to I don't want to say your efforts in in pointing out those those computers in your intimate knowledge of that environment I think it's commendable and and well not only commendable but it's instrumental in actually finding out what is truly sort of was truly active versus versus what's truly you know what is that what is stale right so so so so this is this is going to be instrumental and I think you know the great news here that that that are are dedicated on site Ramon Ramon is you know you're Raymond really you know he he you know he's you know his his input is appreciated right so so yeah absolutely his his input is absolutely appreciated on this and I really appreciate your input on this room 1 and so so so I I just want to say something that that you know that Ramona really really appreciate your input on this and that's great so so if we don't have laptops named that that such we can go mark this market essentially right and so the other computer that you're mentioning there ramone cpha 2021 N B005 so really appreciate input on that as well to Ramon thank you so much for that and if we don't have anybody so can we can we can we install is it possible that we can you know like if this computer is going to be there's any plans to assign this computer to anybody I say let's go ahead and and have it have it any business ready state and have it enrolled in Microsoft intune so if you can go ahead and install go to resolve on it I can I can send you here I'll actually send you a link on this e-mail here I'm including a link on this e-mail here for the go to resolve unattended Asian civic install that agent on the on the unit on the machine that would be would be much much appreciated an I would really appreciate you know you are doing that as well Ramon if you can install the go to resolve because that's going to be our sort of action plan or attack plan here right so essentially all computers that are remaining or going to be contacting the users were going to be working with them closely to install the unattended Asian so that we can have ability to remotely access their machine and and and you know and be able to troubleshoot without you know an as needed you know sometimes needed you know without having to you know essentially so we're able to access mean it doesn't have to be unattended right maybe it's a one time but at least since this computer there's no one is using it at the moment so give us a little flexibility so we can mix mix and match between maybe the unattended agent and the sort of the the the one time agent right so so yeah if we can do that there will be that we much appreciated yeah aside from that really you know what else we have here so those those are the two really two computers that you pointed out ramona really appreciate you you're pointing out as although I I do want to clarify Ramon that that you know I I do want to clarify Ramon that that that computer cpha 2023 NB 004 I do see the last logon timestamp for this computer on the domain controller as February 23rd so on February 23rd I see a last logon attempt so obviously it's been awhile right I mean February is quite some time ago alright so we're in may now so I almost almost ended me right so so so we're I think I think by now probably you know we could we definitely mean since the last logon temples February on that computer object on that specific computer object maybe it was renamed after like and then maybe this name left was behind then we can certainly you know go ahead and mark and mark this and mark this as a stale computer so i really appreciate appreciate your input on this so
